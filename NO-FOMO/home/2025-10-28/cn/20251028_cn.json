    "summary": "An individual successfully leveraged artificial intelligence to dramatically reduce a substantial hospital bill, negotiating an initial charge of $195,000 down to $33,000. This remarkable outcome showcases the advanced capabilities of AI in navigating complex and often challenging financial negotiation processes within the healthcare sector. The application highlights AI's potential to serve as a powerful tool for consumer advocacy, automating the intricate steps involved in disputing and subsequently lowering medical expenses. This specific instance illustrates how AI-driven systems can effectively analyze detailed billing statements, identify potential overcharges or opportunities for reduction, and formulate persuasive arguments for negotiation. Such technologies are poised to revolutionize how individuals manage their healthcare finances, offering a new frontier in cost containment and promoting greater transparency and fairness in medical billing practices. The success of this AI-led negotiation also points towards a future where automated personal financial agents could routinely handle complex administrative tasks, providing substantial financial relief and efficiency gains for everyday consumers.",

    "summary": "Real-world tasks require decisions at varying granularities, and humans excel at this by leveraging a unified cognitive representation where planning is fundamentally understood as a high-level form of action. However, current Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents lack this crucial capability to operate fluidly across decision granularities. This limitation stems from existing paradigms that enforce a rigid separation between high-level planning and low-level action, which impairs dynamic adaptability and limits generalization. We propose ReCode (Recursive Code Generation), a novel paradigm that addresses this limitation by unifying planning and action within a single code representation. In this representation, ReCode treats high-level plans as abstract placeholder functions, which the agent then recursively decomposes into finer-grained sub-functions until reaching primitive actions. This recursive approach dissolves the rigid boundary between plan and action, enabling the agent to dynamically control its decision granularity. Furthermore, the recursive structure inherently generates rich, multi-granularity training data, enabling models to learn hierarchical decision-making processes. Extensive experiments show ReCode significantly surpasses advanced baselines in inference performance and demonstrates exceptional data efficiency in training, validating our core insight that unifying planning and action through recursive code generation is a powerful and effective approach to achieving universal granularity control. The code is available at https://github.com/FoundationAgents/ReCode.",

    "summary": "The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has spurred the emergence of data agents--autonomous systems designed to orchestrate Data + AI ecosystems for tackling complex data-related tasks. However, the term \"data agent\" currently suffers from terminological ambiguity and inconsistent adoption, conflating simple query responders with sophisticated autonomous architectures. This terminological ambiguity fosters mismatched user expectations, accountability challenges, and barriers to industry growth. Inspired by the SAE J3016 standard for driving automation, this survey introduces the first systematic hierarchical taxonomy for data agents, comprising six levels that delineate and trace progressive shifts in autonomy, from manual operations (L0) to a vision of generative, fully autonomous data agents (L5), thereby clarifying capability boundaries and responsibility allocation. Through this lens, we offer a structured review of existing research arranged by increasing autonomy, encompassing specialized data agents for data management, preparation, and analysis, alongside emerging efforts toward versatile, comprehensive systems with enhanced autonomy. We further analyze critical evolutionary leaps and technical gaps for advancing data agents, especially the ongoing L2-to-L3 transition, where data agents evolve from procedural execution to autonomous orchestration. Finally, we conclude with a forward-looking roadmap, envisioning the advent of proactive, generative data agents.",

To bridge this gap, we introduceORIG, an agentic open multimodal retrieval-augmented framework for FactualImage Generation (FIG), a new task that requires both visual realism andfactual grounding. ORIG iteratively retrieves and filters multimodal evidencefrom the web and incrementally integrates the refined knowledge into enrichedprompts to guide generation. To support systematic evaluation, we buildFIG-Eval, a benchmark spanning ten categories across perceptual, compositional,and temporal dimensions.

In this work, we focus on optimizing the max@k metric, a continuous generalization of pass@k. We derive an unbiased on-policy gradient estimate for direct optimization of this metric. Furthermore, we extend our derivations to the off-policy updates, a common element in modern RLVR algorithms, that allows better sample efficiency.

    "summary": "Current 3D/4D generation methods are usually optimized for photorealism, efficiency, and aesthetics. However, they often fail to preserve the semantic identity of the subject across different viewpoints. Adapting generation methods with one or few images of a specific subject (also known as Personalization or Subject-driven generation) allows generating visual content that align with the identity of the subject. However, personalized 3D/4D generation is still largely underexplored. In this work, we introduce TIRE (Track, Inpaint, REsplat), a novel method for subject-driven 3D/4D generation. It takes an initial 3D asset produced by an existing 3D generative model as input and uses video tracking to identify the regions that need to be modified. Then, we adopt a subject-driven 2D inpainting model for progressively infilling the identified regions. Finally, we resplat the modified 2D multi-view observations back to 3D while still maintaining consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly improves identity preservation in 3D/4D generation compared to state-of-the-art methods.
