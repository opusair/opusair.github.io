    "summary": "The widespread adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools was initially anticipated to democratize productivity and empower junior professionals by automating routine tasks and providing quick access to information. However, observations suggest a counter-intuitive trend: AI predominantly enhances the capabilities of senior employees, further solidifying their advantage. This phenomenon stems from seniors' foundational strengths in critical thinking, domain-specific knowledge, and the ability to accurately contextualize and validate AI-generated outputs. For experienced professionals, AI functions as a powerful accelerator, enabling them to process complex information, refine strategies, and execute tasks with unprecedented efficiency. They leverage AI to offload cognitive burdens, freeing up mental capacity for higher-level problem-solving and strategic decision-making. Conversely, junior staff, who may lack the deep contextual understanding or the critical judgment required to effectively prompt, evaluate, and integrate AI outputs, often find the tools less transformative. Without a robust internal model of their domain, juniors may struggle to discern the nuances of AI suggestions or identify potential inaccuracies, limiting the true benefit of these advanced tools. Consequently, AI appears to amplify existing expertise, making skilled individuals even more productive, and potentially widening the skill and productivity gap within organizations rather than narrowing it.",
