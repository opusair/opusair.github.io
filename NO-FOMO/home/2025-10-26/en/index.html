                <p class="summary">Handy is a robust, free, open-source, and extensible cross-platform desktop application providing privacy-focused, offline speech-to-text transcription capabilities. Developed with Tauri, combining Rust for backend system integration, audio processing, and machine learning inference, and React/TypeScript with Tailwind CSS for the frontend, Handy allows users to effortlessly transcribe spoken words directly into any active text field through a configurable keyboard shortcut. A key differentiator is its commitment to privacy, ensuring that all audio processing and transcription occurs entirely on the user's local machine, eliminating the need to transmit sensitive voice data to cloud services. The application employs sophisticated local processing techniques, including Voice Activity Detection (VAD) utilizing Silero, and offers flexible speech recognition options such as GPU-accelerated Whisper models (Small/Medium/Turbo/Large) or the highly efficient, CPU-optimized Parakeet V3 model, which also boasts automatic language detection. Handy is designed for broad compatibility, supporting Windows, macOS, and Linux, and aims to be a foundational, "forkable" tool that serves as both a useful utility and a platform for community contributions, fostering further innovation in accessible speech technology.</p>

                <p class="summary">Agent Lightning is a Microsoft project designed to train and optimize AI agents with minimal code changes. This versatile framework supports any agent framework, including LangChain, OpenAI Agent SDK, AutoGen, and CrewAI, or even custom Python OpenAI integrations. It enables selective optimization within multi-agent systems and incorporates advanced algorithms like Reinforcement Learning, Automatic Prompt Optimization, and Supervised Fine-tuning. The architecture is lightweight, using an `agl.emit_xxx()` helper or tracer to capture events (prompts, tool calls, rewards) into a central LightningStore. This store synchronizes tasks, resources, and traces, which are then processed by selected algorithms to learn and refine agent behavior. A Trainer component orchestrates data streaming, resource transfer, and updates to the inference engine. Agent Lightning provides a clear pathway from initial agent rollout to continuous improvement without requiring significant rewrites or vendor lock-in, making it a powerful tool for developing robust and intelligent AI agents.</p>
