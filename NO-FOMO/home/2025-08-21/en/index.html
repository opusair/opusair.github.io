  Optimization">
                <p class="summary">We present DuPO, a dual learning-based preference optimization framework that
generates annotation-free feedback via a generalized duality. DuPO addresses
two key limitations: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR)'s
reliance on costly labels and applicability restricted to verifiable tasks, and
traditional dual learning's restriction to strictly dual task pairs (e.g.,
translation and back-translation). Specifically, DuPO decomposes a primal
task's input into known and unknown components, then constructs its dual task
to reconstruct the unknown part using the primal output and known information
(e.g., reversing math solutions to recover hidden variables), broadening
applicability to non-invertible tasks. The quality of this reconstruction
serves as a self-supervised reward to optimize the primal task, synergizing
with LLMs' ability to instantiate both tasks via a single model. Empirically,
DuPO achieves substantial gains across diverse tasks: it enhances the average
translation quality by 2.13 COMET over 756 directions, boosts the mathematical
reasoning accuracy by an average of 6.4 points on three challenge benchmarks,
and enhances performance by 9.3 points as an inference-time reranker (trading
computation for accuracy). These results position DuPO as a scalable, general,
and annotation-free paradigm for LLM optimization.</p>

                <p class="summary">Future prediction is a complex task for LLM agents, requiring a high level of
analytical thinking, information gathering, contextual understanding, and
decision-making under uncertainty. Agents must not only gather and interpret
vast amounts of dynamic information but also integrate diverse data sources,
weigh uncertainties, and adapt predictions based on emerging trends, just as
human experts do in fields like politics, economics, and finance. Despite its
importance, no large-scale benchmark exists for evaluating agents on future
prediction, largely due to challenges in handling real-time updates and
retrieving timely, accurate answers. To address this, we introduce
FutureX, a dynamic and live evaluation benchmark specifically
designed for LLM agents performing future prediction tasks. FutureX is the
largest and most diverse live benchmark for future prediction, supporting
real-time daily updates and eliminating data contamination through an automated
pipeline for question gathering and answer collection. We evaluate 25 LLM/agent
models, including those with reasoning, search capabilities, and integration of
external tools such as the open-source Deep Research Agent and closed-source
Deep Research models. This comprehensive evaluation assesses agents' adaptive
reasoning and performance in dynamic environments. Additionally, we provide
in-depth analyses of agents' failure modes and performance pitfalls in
future-oriented tasks, including the vulnerability to fake web pages and the
temporal validity. Our goal is to establish a dynamic, contamination-free
evaluation standard that drives the development of LLM agents capable of
performing at the level of professional human analysts in complex reasoning and
predictive thinking.</p>

                <p class="summary">Reconstructing 3D objects into editable programs is pivotal for applications
like reverse engineering and shape editing. However, existing methods often
rely on limited domain-specific languages (DSLs) and small-scale datasets,
restricting their ability to model complex geometries and structures. To
address these challenges, we introduce MeshCoder, a novel framework that
reconstructs complex 3D objects from point clouds into editable Blender Python
scripts. We develop a comprehensive set of expressive Blender Python APIs
capable of synthesizing intricate geometries. Leveraging these APIs, we
construct a large-scale paired object-code dataset, where the code for each
object is decomposed into distinct semantic parts. Subsequently, we train a
multimodal large language model (LLM) that translates 3D point cloud into
executable Blender Python scripts. Our approach not only achieves superior
performance in shape-to-code reconstruction tasks but also facilitates
intuitive geometric and topological editing through convenient code
modifications. Furthermore, our code-based representation enhances the
reasoning capabilities of LLMs in 3D shape understanding tasks. Together, these
contributions establish MeshCoder as a powerful and flexible solution for
programmatic 3D shape reconstruction and understanding.</p>

  Sparse Inputs without Per-Scene Optimization">
                <p class="summary">We introduce Tinker, a versatile framework for high-fidelity 3D editing that
operates in both one-shot and few-shot regimes without any per-scene
finetuning. Unlike prior techniques that demand extensive per-scene
optimization to ensure multi-view consistency or to produce dozens of
consistent edited input views, Tinker delivers robust, multi-view consistent
edits from as few as one or two images. This capability stems from repurposing
pretrained diffusion models, which unlocks their latent 3D awareness. To drive
research in this space, we curate the first large-scale multi-view editing
dataset and data pipeline, spanning diverse scenes and styles. Building on this
dataset, we develop our framework capable of generating multi-view consistent
edited views without per-scene training, which consists of two novel
components: (1) Referring multi-view editor: Enables precise, reference-driven
edits that remain coherent across all viewpoints. (2) Any-view-to-video
synthesizer: Leverages spatial-temporal priors from video diffusion to perform
high-quality scene completion and novel-view generation even from sparse
inputs. Through extensive experiments, Tinker significantly reduces the barrier
to generalizable 3D content creation, achieving state-of-the-art performance on
editing, novel-view synthesis, and rendering enhancement tasks. We believe that
Tinker represents a key step towards truly scalable, zero-shot 3D editing.

  Context Protocol Servers">
                <p class="summary">The Model Context Protocol has emerged as a transformative standard for
connecting large language models to external data sources and tools, rapidly
gaining adoption across major AI providers and development platforms. However,
existing benchmarks are overly simplistic and fail to capture real application
challenges such as long-horizon reasoning and large, unfamiliar tool spaces. To
address this critical gap, we introduce MCP-Universe, the first comprehensive
benchmark specifically designed to evaluate LLMs in realistic and hard tasks
through interaction with real-world MCP servers. Our benchmark encompasses 6
core domains spanning 11 different MCP servers: Location Navigation, Repository
Management, Financial Analysis, 3D Design, Browser Automation, and Web
Searching. To ensure rigorous evaluation, we implement execution-based
evaluators, including format evaluators for agent format compliance, static
evaluators for time-invariant content matching, and dynamic evaluators that
automatically retrieve real-time ground truth for temporally sensitive tasks.
Through extensive evaluation of leading LLMs, we find that even SOTA models
such as GPT-5 (43.72%), Grok-4 (33.33%) and Claude-4.0-Sonnet (29.44%) exhibit
significant performance limitations. In addition, our benchmark poses a
significant long-context challenge for LLM agents, as the number of input
tokens increases rapidly with the number of interaction steps. Moreover, it
introduces an unknown-tools challenge, as LLM agents often lack familiarity
with the precise usage of the MCP servers. Notably, enterprise-level agents
like Cursor cannot achieve better performance than standard ReAct frameworks.
Beyond evaluation, we open-source our extensible evaluation framework with UI
support, enabling researchers and practitioners to seamlessly integrate new
agents and MCP servers while fostering innovation in the rapidly evolving MCP
ecosystem.</p>

                <p class="summary">Artificial intelligence (AI) is reshaping scientific discovery, evolving from
specialized computational tools into autonomous research partners. We position
Agentic Science as a pivotal stage within the broader AI for Science paradigm,
where AI systems progress from partial assistance to full scientific agency.
Enabled by large language models (LLMs), multimodal systems, and integrated
research platforms, agentic AI shows capabilities in hypothesis generation,
experimental design, execution, analysis, and iterative refinement -- behaviors
once regarded as uniquely human. This survey provides a domain-oriented review
of autonomous scientific discovery across life sciences, chemistry, materials
science, and physics. We unify three previously fragmented perspectives --
process-oriented, autonomy-oriented, and mechanism-oriented -- through a
comprehensive framework that connects foundational capabilities, core
processes, and domain-specific realizations. Building on this framework, we (i)
trace the evolution of AI for Science, (ii) identify five core capabilities
underpinning scientific agency, (iii) model discovery as a dynamic four-stage
workflow, (iv) review applications across the above domains, and (v) synthesize
key challenges and future opportunities. This work establishes a
domain-oriented synthesis of autonomous scientific discovery and positions
Agentic Science as a structured paradigm for advancing AI-driven research.</p>
