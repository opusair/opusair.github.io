DuPO addresses\ntwo key limitations: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR)'s\nreliance on costly labels and applicability restricted to verifiable tasks, and\ntraditional dual learning's restriction to strictly dual task pairs (e.g.,\ntranslation and back-translation). Specifically, DuPO decomposes a primal\ntask's input into known and unknown components, then constructs its dual task\nto reconstruct the unknown part using the primal output and known information\n(e.g., reversing math solutions to recover hidden variables), broadening\napplicability to non-invertible tasks. The quality of this reconstruction\nserves as a self-supervised reward to optimize the primal task, synergizing\nwith LLMs' ability to instantiate both tasks via a single model. Empirically,\nDuPO achieves substantial gains across diverse tasks: it enhances the average\ntranslation quality by 2.13 COMET over 756 directions, boosts the mathematical\nreasoning accuracy by an average of 6.4 points on three challenge benchmarks,\nand enhances performance by 9.3 points as an inference-time reranker (trading\ncomputation for accuracy).

    "summary_en": "Future prediction is a complex task for LLM agents, requiring a high level of\nanalytical thinking, information gathering, contextual understanding, and\ndecision-making under uncertainty. Agents must not only gather and interpret\nvast amounts of dynamic information but also integrate diverse data sources,\nweigh uncertainties, and adapt predictions based on emerging trends, just as\nhuman experts do in fields like politics, economics, and finance. Despite its\nimportance, no large-scale benchmark exists for evaluating agents on future\nprediction, largely due to challenges in handling real-time updates and\nretrieving timely, accurate answers. To address this, we introduce\nFutureX, a dynamic and live evaluation benchmark specifically\ndesigned for LLM agents performing future prediction tasks. FutureX is the\nlargest and most diverse live benchmark for future prediction, supporting\nreal-time daily updates and eliminating data contamination through an automated\npipeline for question gathering and answer collection. We evaluate 25 LLM/agent\nmodels, including those with reasoning, search capabilities, and integration of\nexternal tools such as the open-source Deep Research Agent and closed-source\nDeep Research models. This comprehensive evaluation assesses agents' adaptive\nreasoning and performance in dynamic environments. Additionally, we provide\nin-depth analyses of agents' failure modes and performance pitfalls in\nfuture-oriented tasks, including the vulnerability to fake web pages and the\ntemporal validity. Our goal is to establish a dynamic, contamination-free\nevaluation standard that drives the development of LLM agents capable of\nperforming at the level of professional human analysts in complex reasoning and\npredictive thinking.",

However, existing methods often\nrely on limited domain-specific languages (DSLs) and small-scale datasets,\nrestricting their ability to model complex geometries and structures. To\naddress these challenges, we introduce MeshCoder, a novel framework that\nreconstructs complex 3D objects from point clouds into editable Blender Python\nscripts. We develop a comprehensive set of expressive Blender Python APIs\ncapable of synthesizing intricate geometries. Leveraging these APIs, we\nconstruct a large-scale paired object-code dataset, where the code for each\nobject is decomposed into distinct semantic parts. Subsequently, we train a\nmultimodal large language model (LLM) that translates 3D point cloud into\nexecutable Blender Python scripts. Our approach not only achieves superior\nperformance in shape-to-code reconstruction tasks but also facilitates\nintuitive geometric and topological editing through convenient code\nmodifications. Furthermore, our code-based representation enhances the\nreasoning capabilities of LLMs in 3D shape understanding tasks. Together, these\ncontributions establish MeshCoder as a powerful and flexible solution for\nprogrammatic 3D shape reconstruction and understanding.",

    "title_en": "Tinker: Diffusion's Gift to 3D--Multi-View Consistent Editing From\n  Sparse Inputs without Per-Scene Optimization",
    "summary_en": "We introduce Tinker, a versatile framework for high-fidelity 3D editing that\noperates in both one-shot and few-shot regimes without any per-scene\nfinetuning. Unlike prior techniques that demand extensive per-scene\noptimization to ensure multi-view consistency or to produce dozens of\nconsistent edited input views, Tinker delivers robust, multi-view consistent\nedits from as few as one or two images. This capability stems from repurposing\npretrained diffusion models, which unlocks their latent 3D awareness. To drive\nresearch in this space, we curate the first large-scale multi-view editing\ndataset and data pipeline, spanning diverse scenes and styles. Building on this\ndataset, we develop our framework capable of generating multi-view consistent\nedited views without per-scene training, which consists of two novel\ncomponents: (1) Referring multi-view editor: Enables precise, reference-driven\nedits that remain coherent across all viewpoints. (2) Any-view-to-video\nsynthesizer: Leverages spatial-temporal priors from video diffusion to perform\nhigh-quality scene completion and novel-view generation even from sparse\ninputs. Through extensive experiments, Tinker significantly reduces the barrier\nto generalizable 3D content creation, achieving state-of-the-art performance on\nediting, novel-view synthesis, and rendering enhancement tasks. We believe that\nTinker represents a key step towards truly scalable, zero-shot 3D editing.\nProject webpage: https://aim-uofa.github.io/Tinker",

    "title_en": "MCP-Universe: Benchmarking Large Language Models with Real-World Model\n  Context Protocol Servers",
    "summary_en": "The Model Context Protocol has emerged as a transformative standard for\nconnecting large language models to external data sources and tools, rapidly\ngaining adoption across major AI providers and development platforms. However,\nexisting benchmarks are overly simplistic and fail to capture real application\nchallenges such as long-horizon reasoning and large, unfamiliar tool spaces. To\naddress this critical gap, we introduce MCP-Universe, the first comprehensive\nbenchmark specifically designed to evaluate LLMs in realistic and hard tasks\nthrough interaction with real-world MCP servers. Our benchmark encompasses 6\ncore domains spanning 11 different MCP servers: Location Navigation, Repository\nManagement, Financial Analysis, 3D Design, Browser Automation, and Web\nSearching. To ensure rigorous evaluation, we implement execution-based\nevaluators, including format evaluators for agent format compliance, static\nevaluators for time-invariant content matching, and dynamic evaluators that\nautomatically retrieve real-time ground truth for temporally sensitive tasks.\nThrough extensive evaluation of leading LLMs, we find that even SOTA models\nsuch as GPT-5 (43.72%), Grok-4 (33.33%) and Claude-4.0-Sonnet (29.44%) exhibit\nsignificant performance limitations. In addition, our benchmark poses a\nsignificant long-context challenge for LLM agents, as the number of input\ntokens increases rapidly with the number of interaction steps. Moreover, it\nintroduces an unknown-tools challenge, as LLM agents often lack familiarity\nwith the precise usage of the MCP servers. Notably, enterprise-level agents\nlike Cursor cannot achieve better performance than standard ReAct frameworks.\nBeyond evaluation, we open-source our extensible evaluation framework with UI\nsupport, enabling researchers and practitioners to seamlessly integrate new\nagents and MCP servers while fostering innovation in the rapidly evolving MCP\necosystem.",

We position\nAgentic Science as a pivotal stage within the broader AI for Science paradigm,\nwhere AI systems progress from partial assistance to full scientific agency.\nEnabled by large language models (LLMs), multimodal systems, and integrated\nresearch platforms, agentic AI shows capabilities in hypothesis generation,\nexperimental design, execution, analysis, and iterative refinement -- behaviors\nonce regarded as uniquely human. This survey provides a domain-oriented review\nof autonomous scientific discovery across life sciences, chemistry, materials\nscience, and physics. We unify three previously fragmented perspectives --\nprocess-oriented, autonomy-oriented, and mechanism-oriented -- through a\ncomprehensive framework that connects foundational capabilities, core\nprocesses, and domain-specific realizations. Building on this framework, we (i)\ntrace the evolution of AI for Science, (ii) identify five core capabilities\nunderpinning scientific agency, (iii) model discovery as a dynamic four-stage\nworkflow, (iv) review applications across the above domains, and (v) synthesize\nkey challenges and future opportunities.
