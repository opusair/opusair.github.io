    "summary_en": "We investigate the potential of large language models (LLMs) to serve as\nefficient simulators for agentic search tasks in reinforcement learning (RL),\nthereby reducing dependence on costly interactions with external search\nengines. To this end, we first quantify the intrinsic search capability of LLMs\nvia structured prompting and repeated sampling, which we term Self-Search. Our\nresults reveal that LLMs exhibit strong scaling behavior with respect to the\ninference budget, achieving high pass@k on question-answering benchmarks,\nincluding the challenging BrowseComp task. Building on these observations, we\nintroduce Self-Search RL (SSRL), which enhances LLMs' Self-Search capability\nthrough format-based and rule-based rewards. SSRL enables models to iteratively\nrefine their knowledge utilization internally, without requiring access to\nexternal tools. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that SSRL-trained policy\nmodels provide a cost-effective and stable environment for search-driven RL\ntraining, reducing reliance on external search engines and facilitating robust\nsim-to-real transfer. We draw the following conclusions: 1) LLMs possess world\nknowledge that can be effectively elicited to achieve high performance; 2) SSRL\ndemonstrates the potential of leveraging internal knowledge to reduce\nhallucination; 3) SSRL-trained models integrate seamlessly with external search\nengines without additional effort. Our findings highlight the potential of LLMs\nto support more scalable RL agent training.",

    "title_en": "Thyme: Think Beyond Images",
    "summary_en": "Following OpenAI's introduction of the ``thinking with images'' concept,\nrecent efforts have explored stimulating the use of visual information in the\nreasoning process to enhance model performance in perception and reasoning\ntasks. However, to the best of our knowledge, no open-source work currently\noffers a feature set as rich as proprietary models (O3), which can perform\ndiverse image manipulations and simultaneously enhance logical reasoning\ncapabilities through code. In this paper, we make a preliminary attempt in this\ndirection by introducing Thyme (Think Beyond Images), a novel paradigm for\nenabling MLLMs to transcend existing ``think with images'' approaches by\nautonomously generating and executing diverse image processing and\ncomputational operations via executable code. This approach not only\nfacilitates a rich, on-the-fly set of image manipulations (e.g., cropping,\nrotation, contrast enhancement) but also allows for mathematical computations,\nall while maintaining high autonomy in deciding when and how to apply these\noperations. We activate this capability through a two-stage training strategy:\nan initial SFT on a curated dataset of 500K samples to teach code generation,\nfollowed by a RL phase to refine decision-making. For the RL stage, we manually\ncollect and design high-resolution question-answer pairs to increase the\nlearning difficulty, and we propose GRPO-ATS (Group Relative Policy\nOptimization with Adaptive Temperature Sampling), an algorithm that applies\ndistinct temperatures to text and code generation to balance reasoning\nexploration with code execution precision. We conduct extensive experimental\nanalysis and ablation studies. Comprehensive evaluations on nearly 20\nbenchmarks show that Thyme yields significant and consistent performance gains,\nparticularly in challenging high-resolution perception and complex reasoning\ntasks.",

    "summary_en": "Recent advances in large language model (LLM) pretraining have shown that\nsimply scaling data quantity eventually leads to diminishing returns, hitting a\ndata wall. In response, the use of synthetic data for pretraining has emerged\nas a promising paradigm for pushing the frontier of performance. Despite this,\nthe factors affecting synthetic data quality remain poorly understood. In this\nwork, we introduce BeyondWeb, a synthetic data generation framework that\nproduces high-quality synthetic data for pretraining. BeyondWeb significantly\nextends the capabilities of traditional web-scale datasets, outperforming\nstate-of-the-art synthetic pretraining datasets such as Cosmopedia and\nNemotron-CC's high-quality synthetic subset (Nemotron-Synth) by up to 5.1\npercentage points (pp) and 2.6pp, respectively, when averaged across a suite of\n14 benchmark evaluations. It delivers up to 7.7x faster training than open web\ndata and 2.7x faster than Nemotron-Synth. Remarkably, a 3B model trained for\n180B tokens on BeyondWeb outperforms an 8B model trained for the same token\nbudget on Cosmopedia. We also present several insights from BeyondWeb on\nsynthetic data for pretraining: what drives its benefits, which data to\nrephrase and how, and the impact of model size and family on data quality.\nOverall, our work shows that there's no silver bullet for generating\nhigh-quality synthetic pretraining data. The best outcomes require jointly\noptimizing many factors, a challenging task that requires rigorous science and\npractical expertise. Naive approaches can yield modest improvements,\npotentially at great cost, while well-executed methods can yield transformative\nimprovements, as exemplified by BeyondWeb.",

    "summary_en": "Although LLM inference has emerged as a critical workload for many downstream\napplications, efficiently inferring LLMs is challenging due to the substantial\nmemory footprint and bandwidth requirements. In parallel, compute capabilities\nhave steadily outpaced both memory capacity and bandwidth over the last few\ndecades, a trend that remains evident in modern GPU hardware and exacerbates\nthe challenge of LLM inference. As such, new algorithms are emerging that trade\nincreased computation for reduced memory operations. To that end, we present\nXQuant, which takes advantage of this trend, enabling an order-of-magnitude\nreduction in memory consumption through low-bit quantization with substantial\naccuracy benefits relative to state-of-the-art KV cache quantization methods.\nWe accomplish this by quantizing and caching the layer input activations X,\ninstead of using standard KV caching, and then rematerializing the Keys and\nValues on-the-fly during inference. This results in an immediate 2times\nmemory savings compared to KV caching. By applying XQuant, we achieve up to\nsim 7.7times memory savings with <0.1 perplexity degradation compared to\nthe FP16 baseline. Furthermore, our approach leverages the fact that X values\nare similar across layers. Building on this observation, we introduce\nXQuant-CL, which exploits the cross-layer similarity in the X embeddings for\nextreme compression. Across different models, XQuant-CL attains up to\n10times memory savings relative to the FP16 baseline with only 0.01\nperplexity degradation, and 12.5times memory savings with only 0.1\nperplexity degradation. XQuant exploits the rapidly increasing compute\ncapabilities of hardware platforms to eliminate the memory bottleneck, while\nsurpassing state-of-the-art KV cache quantization methods and achieving\nnear-FP16 accuracy across a wide range of models.",

    "summary_en": "Recent advances in audio-driven portrait animation have demonstrated\nimpressive capabilities. However, existing methods struggle to align with\nfine-grained human preferences across multiple dimensions, such as motion\nnaturalness, lip-sync accuracy, and visual quality. This is due to the\ndifficulty of optimizing among competing preference objectives, which often\nconflict with one another, and the scarcity of large-scale, high-quality\ndatasets with multidimensional preference annotations. To address these, we\nfirst introduce Talking-Critic, a multimodal reward model that learns\nhuman-aligned reward functions to quantify how well generated videos satisfy\nmultidimensional expectations. Leveraging this model, we curate Talking-NSQ, a\nlarge-scale multidimensional human preference dataset containing 410K\npreference pairs. Finally, we propose Timestep-Layer adaptive multi-expert\nPreference Optimization (TLPO), a novel framework for aligning diffusion-based\nportrait animation models with fine-grained, multidimensional preferences. TLPO\ndecouples preferences into specialized expert modules, which are then fused\nacross timesteps and network layers, enabling comprehensive, fine-grained\nenhancement across all dimensions without mutual interference. Experiments\ndemonstrate that Talking-Critic significantly outperforms existing methods in\naligning with human preference ratings. Meanwhile, TLPO achieves substantial\nimprovements over baseline models in lip-sync accuracy, motion naturalness, and\nvisual quality, exhibiting superior performance in both qualitative and\nquantitative evaluations.
