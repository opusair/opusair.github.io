    "summary": "A Hacker News post questions whether AI has eroded the inherent satisfaction in programming. The author articulates a significant shift from traditional coding, where thorough problem understanding, architectural design, and manual implementation were crucial, fostering a deep sense of accomplishment. In contrast, modern AI coding tools promise to automate the cognitive aspects of programming, encouraging developers to describe problems and expect ready-made solutions without needing to grasp intricate details. This new paradigm creates a perceived pressure to delegate complex problem-solving to AI, leading to a process of simply describing issues and iterating with AI-generated outputs. The author contends that this approach, even when successful, results in \"zero satisfaction\" due to a lack of profound understanding of the solution and diminished ownership over the developed code. Consequently, the core intellectual reward and personal fulfillment traditionally associated with programming are significantly reduced.",

Traditionally viewed as an arduous and low-level discipline, assembly offers unparalleled control over hardware, a capability the author posits could be crucial for optimizing AI algorithms and unlocking new computational efficiencies. The piece delves into the 'brutal' complexity inherent in assembly programming, contrasting it with its 'beautiful' ability to maximize performance at the bare metal level. It suggests that a deeper, foundational understanding of computer architecture, which is inherently fostered by assembly programming, might lead to significant breakthroughs in AI development, particularly in areas requiring extreme resource optimization and novel hardware utilization. By stripping away the layers of abstraction provided by higher-level programming languages, developers could potentially craft more efficient neural networks or create entirely new AI paradigms that leverage computing hardware far more effectively than current approaches.

    "summary": "AI control protocols serve as a defense mechanism to stop untrusted LLM agents from causing harm in autonomous settings. Prior work treats this as a security problem, stress testing with exploits that use the deployment context to subtly complete harmful side tasks, such as backdoor insertion. In practice, most AI control protocols are fundamentally based on LLM monitors, which can become a central point of failure. We study adaptive attacks by an untrusted model that knows the protocol and the monitor model, which is plausible if the untrusted model was trained with a later knowledge cutoff or can search for this information autonomously. We instantiate a simple adaptive attack vector by which the attacker embeds publicly known or zero-shot prompt injections in the model outputs. Using this tactic, frontier models consistently evade diverse monitors and complete malicious tasks on two main AI control benchmarks. The attack works universally against current protocols that rely on a monitor. Furthermore, the recent Defer-to-Resample protocol even backfires, as its resampling amplifies the prompt injection and effectively reframes it as a best-of-n attack. In general, adaptive attacks on monitor models represent a major blind spot in current control protocols and should become a standard component of evaluations for future AI control mechanisms.",

    "summary": "Camera-centric understanding and generation are two cornerstones of spatial intelligence, yet they are typically studied in isolation. We present Puffin, a unified camera-centric multimodal model that extends spatial awareness along the camera dimension. Puffin integrates language regression and diffusion-based generation to interpret and create scenes from arbitrary viewpoints. To bridge the modality gap between cameras and vision-language, we introduce a novel paradigm that treats camera as language, enabling thinking with camera. This guides the model to align spatially grounded visual cues with photographic terminology while reasoning across geometric context. Puffin is trained on Puffin-4M, a large-scale dataset of 4 million vision-language-camera triplets. We incorporate both global camera parameters and pixel-wise camera maps, yielding flexible and reliable spatial generation. Experiments demonstrate Puffin superior performance over specialized models for camera-centric generation and understanding. With instruction tuning, Puffin generalizes to diverse cross-view tasks such as spatial imagination, world exploration, and photography guidance. We will release the code, models, dataset pipeline, and benchmark to advance multimodal spatial intelligence research.",

    "summary": "Large language models leverage internet-scale text data, yet embodied AI remains constrained by the prohibitive costs of physical trajectory collection. Desktop environments -- particularly gaming -- offer a compelling alternative: they provide rich sensorimotor interactions at scale while maintaining the structured observation-action coupling essential for embodied learning. We present D2E (Desktop to Embodied AI), a framework that demonstrates desktop interactions can serve as an effective pretraining substrate for robotics embodied AI tasks. Unlike prior work that remained domain-specific (e.g., VPT for Minecraft) or kept data proprietary (e.g., SIMA), D2E establishes a complete pipeline from scalable desktop data collection to verified transfer in embodied domains. Our framework comprises three components: (1) the OWA Toolkit that unifies diverse desktop interactions into a standardized format with 152x compression, (2) the Generalist-IDM that achieves strong zero-shot generalization across unseen games through timestamp-based event prediction, enabling internet-scale pseudo-labeling, and (3) VAPT that transfers desktop-pretrained representations to physical manipulation and navigation. Using 1.3K+ hours of data (259 hours of human demonstrations, and 1K+ hours of pseudo-labeled gameplay), we achieve a total of 96.6% success rate on LIBERO manipulation and 83.3% on CANVAS navigation benchmarks. This validates that sensorimotor primitives in digital interactions exhibit sufficient invariance to transfer meaningfully to physical embodied tasks, establishing desktop pretraining as a practical paradigm for robotics. We will make all our work public, including the OWA toolkit, datasets of human-collected and pseudo-labeled, and VAPT-trained models available at https://worv-ai.github.io/d2e/",

    "title": "Webscale-RL: Automated Data Pipeline for Scaling RL Data to Pretraining Levels",
    "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success through imitation learning on vast text corpora, but this paradigm creates a training-generation gap and limits robust reasoning. Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a more data-efficient solution capable of bridging this gap, yet its application has been constrained by a critical data bottleneck: existing RL datasets are orders of magnitude smaller and less diverse than web-scale pre-training corpora. To address this, we introduce the Webscale-RL pipeline, a scalable data engine that systematically converts large-scale pre-training documents into millions of diverse, verifiable question-answer pairs for RL. Using this pipeline, we construct the Webscale-RL dataset, containing 1.2 million examples across more than 9 domains. Our experiments show that the model trained on this dataset significantly outperforms continual pretraining and strong data refinement baselines across a suite of benchmarks. Notably, RL training with our dataset proves substantially more efficient, achieving the performance of continual pre-training with up to 100times fewer tokens. Our work presents a viable path toward scaling RL to pre-training levels, enabling more capable and efficient language models.",

    "title": "Mind-Paced Speaking: A Dual-Brain Approach to Real-Time Reasoning in Spoken Language Models",
    "summary": "Real-time Spoken Language Models (SLMs) struggle to leverage Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning due to the prohibitive latency of generating the entire thought process sequentially. Enabling SLMs to think while speaking, similar to humans, is attracting increasing attention. We present, for the first time, Mind-Paced Speaking (MPS), a brain-inspired framework that enables high-fidelity, real-time reasoning. Similar to how humans utilize distinct brain regions for thinking and responding, we propose a novel dual-brain approach, employing a \"Formulation Brain\" for high-level reasoning to pace and guide a separate \"Articulation Brain\" for fluent speech generation. This division of labor eliminates mode-switching, preserving the integrity of the reasoning process. Experiments show that MPS significantly outperforms existing think-while-speaking methods and achieves reasoning performance comparable to models that pre-compute the full CoT before speaking, while drastically reducing latency. Under a zero-latency configuration, the proposed method achieves an accuracy of 92.8% on the mathematical reasoning task Spoken-MQA and attains a score of 82.5 on the speech conversation task URO-Bench. Our work effectively bridges the gap between high-quality reasoning and real-time interaction.",
