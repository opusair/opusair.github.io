                <p class="summary">AWS's introduction of S3Vector is disrupting the vector retrieval market with its extremely low storage costs, significantly undercutting traditional solutions. However, S3Vector comes with limitations, including slower query speeds, lower recall rates, and basic functionalities. The article highlights that as large language model (LLM) RAG applications drive an explosion in data volume, vector retrieval costs are soaring, making tiered storage‚Äîespecially leveraging object storage like S3‚Äîan inevitable industry trend. Vector databases are evolving from memory- and disk-based eras towards a tiered storage paradigm. Consequently, vector databases that fail to support similar capabilities or deliver extreme cost-effectiveness will face obsolescence. S3Vector's emergence validates the strong demand for vector storage, educates the market, and fosters innovation, prompting professional vector databases like Milvus to accelerate their iterations. Milvus, for instance, is developing "vector data lake" solutions to address the dual challenges of cost and performance, aiming to provide efficient and economical data management for AI applications. This shift signifies a new era where cost-efficiency and scalability are paramount for vector database survival and growth.</p>

                <p class="summary">Researchers from the University of Maryland and other institutions have introduced "Goldfish Loss," a novel method designed to address the issue of large language models over-memorizing training data. This approach involves randomly discarding a portion of tokens during loss calculation, compelling the model to learn linguistic patterns rather than verbatim replication of the training set. Unlike traditional regularization methods such as Dropout, Goldfish Loss employs a hashing-based masking strategy, ensuring consistent masked positions for identical passages, thereby fundamentally preventing rote memorization. Experiments demonstrate that Goldfish Loss significantly reduces model memorization while maintaining overall performance, enhancing AI's generalization capabilities rather than mere recall. Although it might necessitate more data for compensation, its core principle lies in making models smarter through "selective forgetting."</p>

This approach greatly enhances token efficiency and precision for coding agents. Being free and open-source, Serena augments the capabilities of existing LLMs without additional cost. It supports a wide range of programming languages through Language Server Protocol (LSP) and seamlessly integrates with various clients like Claude Code, Claude Desktop, VSCode, and local GUIs via the Model Context Protocol (MCP), making it a game-changer for navigating and manipulating complex codebases.</p>

                <p class="summary">The emergence of agentic reinforcement learning (Agentic RL) marks a paradigm
shift from conventional reinforcement learning applied to large language models
(LLM RL), reframing LLMs from passive sequence generators into autonomous,
decision-making agents embedded in complex, dynamic worlds. This survey
formalizes this conceptual shift by contrasting the degenerate single-step
Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) of LLM-RL with the temporally extended,
partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) that define Agentic RL.
Building on this foundation, we propose a comprehensive twofold taxonomy: one
organized around core agentic capabilities, including planning, tool use,
memory, reasoning, self-improvement, and perception, and the other around their
applications across diverse task domains. Central to our thesis is that
reinforcement learning serves as the critical mechanism for transforming these
capabilities from static, heuristic modules into adaptive, robust agentic
behavior. To support and accelerate future research, we consolidate the
landscape of open-source environments, benchmarks, and frameworks into a
practical compendium. By synthesizing over five hundred recent works, this
survey charts the contours of this rapidly evolving field and highlights the
opportunities and challenges that will shape the development of scalable,
general-purpose AI agents.</p>

                <p class="summary">Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has demonstrated
success in enhancing LLM reasoning capabilities, but remains limited to
single-turn interactions without tool integration. While recent Agentic
Reinforcement Learning with Tool use (ARLT) approaches have emerged to address
multi-turn tool interactions, existing works develop task-specific codebases
that suffer from fragmentation, synchronous execution bottlenecks, and limited
extensibility across domains. These inefficiencies hinder broader community
adoption and algorithmic innovation. We introduce VerlTool, a unified and
modular framework that addresses these limitations through systematic design
principles. VerlTool provides four key contributions: (1) upstream alignment
with VeRL ensuring compatibility and simplified maintenance, (2) unified tool
management via standardized APIs supporting diverse modalities including code
execution, search, SQL databases, and vision processing, (3) asynchronous
rollout execution achieving near 2times speedup by eliminating
synchronization bottlenecks, and (4) comprehensive evaluation demonstrating
competitive performance across 6 ARLT domains. Our framework formalizes ARLT as
multi-turn trajectories with multi-modal observation tokens (text/image/video),
extending beyond single-turn RLVR paradigms. We train and evaluate models on
mathematical reasoning, knowledge QA, SQL generation, visual reasoning, web
search, and software engineering tasks, achieving results comparable to
specialized systems while providing unified training infrastructure. The
modular plugin architecture enables rapid tool integration requiring only
lightweight Python definitions, significantly reducing development overhead and
providing a scalable foundation for tool-augmented RL research. Our code is
open-sourced at https://github.com/TIGER-AI-Lab/verl-tool.</p>

  RLVR">
                <p class="summary">Recent advances in Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) have
empowered large language models (LLMs) to tackle challenging reasoning tasks
such as mathematics and programming. RLVR leverages verifiable outcome rewards
to guide policy optimization, enabling LLMs to progressively improve output
quality in a grounded and reliable manner. Despite its promise, the RLVR
paradigm poses significant challenges, as existing methods often suffer from
sparse reward signals and unstable policy gradient updates, particularly in
RL-based approaches. To address the challenges, we propose PACS, a
novel RLVR framework that achieves imPlicit Actor
Critic coupling via a Supervised learning framework. By
treating the outcome reward as a predictable label, we reformulate the RLVR
problem into a supervised learning task over a score function parameterized by
the policy model and optimized using cross-entropy loss. A detailed gradient
analysis shows that this supervised formulation inherently recovers the
classical policy gradient update while implicitly coupling actor and critic
roles, yielding more stable and efficient training. Benchmarking on challenging
mathematical reasoning tasks, PACS outperforms strong RLVR baselines, such as
PPO and GRPO, achieving superior reasoning performance. For instance, PACS
achieves 59.78\% at pass@256 on AIME 2025, representing improvements of 13.32
and 14.36 points over PPO and GRPO. This simple yet powerful framework offers a
promising avenue for LLMs post-training with verifiable rewards. Our code and
data are available as open source at https://github.com/ritzz-ai/PACS.</p>

                <p class="summary">Video compositing combines live-action footage to create video production,
serving as a crucial technique in video creation and film production.
Traditional pipelines require intensive labor efforts and expert collaboration,
resulting in lengthy production cycles and high manpower costs. To address this
issue, we automate this process with generative models, called generative video
compositing. This new task strives to adaptively inject identity and motion
information of foreground video to the target video in an interactive manner,
allowing users to customize the size, motion trajectory, and other attributes
of the dynamic elements added in final video. Specifically, we designed a novel
Diffusion Transformer (DiT) pipeline based on its intrinsic properties. To
maintain consistency of the target video before and after editing, we revised a
light-weight DiT-based background preservation branch with masked token
injection. As to inherit dynamic elements from other sources, a DiT fusion
block is proposed using full self-attention, along with a simple yet effective
foreground augmentation for training. Besides, for fusing background and
foreground videos with different layouts based on user control, we developed a
novel position embedding, named Extended Rotary Position Embedding (ERoPE).
Finally, we curated a dataset comprising 61K sets of videos for our new task,
called VideoComp. This data includes complete dynamic elements and high-quality
target videos. Experiments demonstrate that our method effectively realizes
generative video compositing, outperforming existing possible solutions in
fidelity and consistency.</p>

                <p class="summary">The recent development of Large Language Models (LLMs) has been accompanied
by an effervescence of novel ideas and methods to better optimize the loss of
deep learning models. Claims from those methods are myriad: from faster
convergence to removing reliance on certain hyperparameters. However, the
diverse experimental protocols used to validate these claims make direct
comparisons between methods challenging. This study presents a comprehensive
evaluation of recent optimization techniques across standardized LLM
pretraining scenarios, systematically varying model size, batch size, and
training duration. Through careful tuning of each method, we provide guidance
to practitioners on which optimizer is best suited for each scenario. For
researchers, our work highlights promising directions for future optimization
research. Finally, by releasing our code and making all experiments fully
reproducible, we hope our efforts can help the development and rigorous
benchmarking of future methods.</p>

                <p class="summary">Traditional alignment methods for Large Vision and Language Models (LVLMs)
primarily rely on human-curated preference data. Human-generated preference
data is costly; machine-generated preference data is limited in quality; and
self-supervised preference data often introduces hallucinations. To overcome
these limitations, we propose a novel Panel-of-Peers learning framework
inspired by collaborative learning among humans. This approach leverages a
panel of LVLMs, each evaluating and learning from their collective outputs
through an iterative self-improvement process. By simulating a peer review
system, our models generate, assess, and refine outputs in response to a
curated set of prompts, mimicking a classroom learning environment. We
demonstrate that this methodology enhances model performance without requiring
extensive human-labeled datasets. Our experiments show significant improvement
across multiple benchmarks, demonstrating the potential of peer evaluations as
a scalable alternative to self-supervised alignment. Notably, we show that
Panel-of-Peers increases the average score on fifteen benchmarks from 48% to
57%</p>
