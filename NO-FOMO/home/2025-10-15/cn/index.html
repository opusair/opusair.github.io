                <span class="published-time">Published: 2025-10-15 06:21:04</span>
                
                <p class="summary">Agentic engineering, as suggested by the title 'Just talk to it,' points to an evolving paradigm in AI development where interaction with intelligent systems shifts from explicit coding to natural language communication. This approach emphasizes building AI agents that can autonomously understand, plan, and execute tasks based on high-level, conversational instructions. It leverages the power of large language models (LLMs) and other advanced AI techniques to create systems that users can simply 'talk to' to achieve desired outcomes, much like conversing with a human expert. The core benefit lies in simplifying the development process, allowing engineers and non-technical users alike to define goals and constraints rather than meticulously specifying every operational step. This method aims to enhance productivity, accelerate innovation, and make AI technology more accessible by lowering the technical barrier to entry. It represents a move towards more intuitive and flexible AI applications, where the focus is on desired results rather than the intricate mechanics of execution.</p>

                <h2>Recursive Language Models (RLMs)</h2>
                <span class="published-time">Published: 2025-10-15 17:43:27</span>
                
                <p class="summary">Recursive Language Models (RLMs) represent a significant conceptual advancement in the field of natural language processing, focusing on the inherent hierarchical and compositional structure of human language. Unlike traditional sequential language models that process text in a linear fashion, RLMs are designed to explicitly capture and leverage the recursive nature of linguistic syntax and semantics. This architectural approach allows them to build representations of phrases, clauses, and entire sentences by combining representations of their constituent parts in a structured, tree-like manner. The primary advantage of RLMs lies in their potential to enhance understanding of long-range dependencies, improve compositional generalization, and facilitate more robust semantic parsing. By integrating recursive mechanisms, these models aim to overcome limitations of purely sequential models in handling complex grammatical constructions and capturing nuanced meanings. This development could lead to more sophisticated language understanding systems capable of generating more coherent and contextually accurate text, and could find applications in advanced machine translation, dialogue systems, and information extraction, offering a promising direction for future NLP research.</p>

                <h2>DITING: A Multi-Agent Evaluation Framework for Benchmarking Web Novel Translation</h2>
                <span class="published-time">Published: 2025-10-10T08:10:10.000Z</span>
                
                <p class="summary">Large language models (LLMs) have substantially advanced machine translation (MT), yet their effectiveness in translating web novels remains unclear. Existing benchmarks rely on surface-level metrics that fail to capture the distinctive traits of this genre. To address these gaps, we introduce DITING, the first comprehensive evaluation framework for web novel translation, assessing narrative and cultural fidelity across six dimensions: idiom translation, lexical ambiguity, terminology localization, tense consistency, zero-pronoun resolution, and cultural safety, supported by over 18K expert-annotated Chinese-English sentence pairs. We further propose AgentEval, a reasoning-driven multi-agent evaluation framework that simulates expert deliberation to assess translation quality beyond lexical overlap, achieving the highest correlation with human judgments among seven tested automatic metrics. To enable metric comparison, we develop MetricAlign, a meta-evaluation dataset of 300 sentence pairs annotated with error labels and scalar quality scores. Comprehensive evaluation of fourteen open, closed, and commercial models reveals that Chinese-trained LLMs surpass larger foreign counterparts, and that DeepSeek-V3 delivers the most faithful and stylistically coherent translations. Our work establishes a new paradigm for exploring LLM-based web novel translation and provides public resources to advance future research.</p>

                <h2>Advancing End-to-End Pixel Space Generative Modeling via Self-supervised Pre-training</h2>
                <span class="published-time">Published: 2025-10-14T14:41:16.000Z</span>
                
                <p class="summary">Pixel-space generative models are often more difficult to train and generally underperform compared to their latent-space counterparts, leaving a persistent performance and efficiency gap. In this paper, we introduce a novel two-stage training framework that closes this gap for pixel-space diffusion and consistency models. In the first stage, we pre-train encoders to capture meaningful semantics from clean images while aligning them with points along the same deterministic sampling trajectory, which evolves points from the prior to the data distribution. In the second stage, we integrate the encoder with a randomly initialized decoder and fine-tune the complete model end-to-end for both diffusion and consistency models. Our training framework demonstrates strong empirical performance on ImageNet dataset. Specifically, our diffusion model reaches an FID of 2.04 on ImageNet-256 and 2.35 on ImageNet-512 with 75 number of function evaluations (NFE), surpassing prior pixel-space methods by a large margin in both generation quality and efficiency while rivaling leading VAE-based models at comparable training cost. Furthermore, on ImageNet-256, our consistency model achieves an impressive FID of 8.82 in a single sampling step, significantly surpassing its latent-space counterpart. To the best of our knowledge, this marks the first successful training of a consistency model directly on high-resolution images without relying on pre-trained VAEs or diffusion models.</p>

                <h2>A Survey of Vibe Coding with Large Language Models</h2>
                <span class="published-time">Published: 2025-10-14T11:26:56.000Z</span>
                
                <p class="summary">The advancement of large language models (LLMs) has catalyzed a paradigm shift from code generation assistance to autonomous coding agents, enabling a novel development methodology termed "Vibe Coding" where developers validate AI-generated implementations through outcome observation rather than line-by-line code comprehension. Despite its transformative potential, the effectiveness of this emergent paradigm remains under-explored, with empirical evidence revealing unexpected productivity losses and fundamental challenges in human-AI collaboration. To address this gap, this survey provides the first comprehensive and systematic review of Vibe Coding with large language models, establishing both theoretical foundations and practical frameworks for this transformative development approach. Drawing from systematic analysis of over 1000 research papers, we survey the entire vibe coding ecosystem, examining critical infrastructure components including LLMs for coding, LLM-based coding agent, development environment of coding agent, and feedback mechanisms. We first introduce Vibe Coding as a formal discipline by formalizing it through a Constrained Markov Decision Process that captures the dynamic triadic relationship among human developers, software projects, and coding agents. Building upon this theoretical foundation, we then synthesize existing practices into five distinct development models: Unconstrained Automation, Iterative Conversational Collaboration, Planning-Driven, Test-Driven, and Context-Enhanced Models, thus providing the first comprehensive taxonomy in this domain. Critically, our analysis reveals that successful Vibe Coding depends not merely on agent capabilities but on systematic context engineering, well-established development environments, and human-agent collaborative development models.</p>

                <h2>FlashVSR: Towards Real-Time Diffusion-Based Streaming Video Super-Resolution</h2>
                <span class="published-time">Published: 2025-10-14T17:25:54.000Z</span>
                
                <p class="summary">Diffusion models have recently advanced video restoration, but applying them to real-world video super-resolution (VSR) remains challenging due to high latency, prohibitive computation, and poor generalization to ultra-high resolutions. Our goal in this work is to make diffusion-based VSR practical by achieving efficiency, scalability, and real-time performance. To this end, we propose FlashVSR, the first diffusion-based one-step streaming framework towards real-time VSR. FlashVSR runs at approximately 17 FPS for 768x1408 videos on a single A100 GPU by combining three complementary innovations: (i) a train-friendly three-stage distillation pipeline that enables streaming super-resolution, (ii) locality-constrained sparse attention that cuts redundant computation while bridging the train-test resolution gap, and (iii) a tiny conditional decoder that accelerates reconstruction without sacrificing quality. To support large-scale training, we also construct VSR-120K, a new dataset with 120k videos and 180k images. Extensive experiments show that FlashVSR scales reliably to ultra-high resolutions and achieves state-of-the-art performance with up to 12x speedup over prior one-step diffusion VSR models. We will release the code, pretrained models, and dataset to foster future research in efficient diffusion-based VSR.</p>

                <h2>Dr.LLM: Dynamic Layer Routing in LLMs</h2>
                <span class="published-time">Published: 2025-10-14T17:51:26.000Z</span>
                
                <p class="summary">Large Language Models (LLMs) process every token through all layers of a transformer stack, causing wasted computation on simple queries and insufficient flexibility for harder ones that need deeper reasoning. Adaptive-depth methods can improve efficiency, but prior approaches rely on costly inference-time search, architectural changes, or large-scale retraining, and in practice often degrade accuracy despite efficiency gains. We introduce Dr.LLM, Dynamic routing of Layers for LLMs, a retrofittable framework that equips pretrained models with lightweight per-layer routers deciding to skip, execute, or repeat a block. Routers are trained with explicit supervision: using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), we derive high-quality layer configurations that preserve or improve accuracy under a compute budget. Our design, windowed pooling for stable routing, focal loss with class balancing, and bottleneck MLP routers, ensures robustness under class imbalance and long sequences. On ARC (logic) and DART (math), Dr.LLM improves accuracy by up to +3.4%p while saving 5 layers per example on average. Routers generalize to out-of-domain tasks (MMLU, GSM8k, AIME, TruthfulQA, SQuADv2, GPQA, PIQA, AGIEval) with only 0.85% accuracy drop while retaining efficiency, and outperform prior routing methods by up to +7.7%p. Overall, Dr.LLM shows that explicitly supervised routers retrofit frozen LLMs for budget-aware, accuracy-driven inference without altering base weights.</p>

                <h2>ERA: Transforming VLMs into Embodied Agents via Embodied Prior Learning and Online Reinforcement Learning</h2>
                <span class="published-time">Published: 2025-10-14T16:25:46.000Z</span>
                
                <p class="summary">Recent advances in embodied AI highlight the potential of vision language models (VLMs) as agents capable of perception, reasoning, and interaction in complex environments. However, top-performing systems rely on large-scale models that are costly to deploy, while smaller VLMs lack the necessary knowledge and skills to succeed. To bridge this gap, we present Embodied Reasoning Agent (ERA), a two-stage framework that integrates prior knowledge learning and online reinforcement learning (RL). The first stage, Embodied Prior Learning, distills foundational knowledge from three types of data: (1) Trajectory-Augmented Priors, which enrich existing trajectory data with structured reasoning generated by stronger models; (2) Environment-Anchored Priors, which provide in-environment knowledge and grounding supervision; and (3) External Knowledge Priors, which transfer general knowledge from out-of-environment datasets. In the second stage, we develop an online RL pipeline that builds on these priors to further enhance agent performance. To overcome the inherent challenges in agent RL, including long horizons, sparse rewards, and training instability, we introduce three key designs: self-summarization for context management, dense reward shaping, and turn-level policy optimization. Extensive experiments on both high-level planning (EB-ALFRED) and low-level control (EB-Manipulation) tasks demonstrate that ERA-3B surpasses both prompting-based large models and previous training-based baselines. Specifically, it achieves overall improvements of 8.4% on EB-ALFRED and 19.4% on EB-Manipulation over GPT-4o, and exhibits strong generalization to unseen tasks. Overall, ERA offers a practical path toward scalable embodied intelligence, providing methodological insights for future embodied AI systems.</p>
