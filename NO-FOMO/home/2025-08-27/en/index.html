                <p class="summary">Prominent AI researcher Fran√ßois Chollet proposes a simple method to distinguish whether a model's correct answer stems from memorization or genuine reasoning. He suggests that when a model provides a correct answer to a reasoning question, one can test its true understanding by subtly tweaking the question. If the modified question requires the model to reason and adapt to produce a new answer, but the model still yields the original answer, it strongly indicates that its response was based on rote memorization rather than true reasoning ability. This practical method offers a valuable approach to evaluating the deeper cognitive capabilities of AI models.</p>

                <p class="summary">The Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm has emerged as a highly effective solution in reinforcement learning, successfully overcoming the inherent instability of traditional Policy Gradient methods and the computational complexity associated with TRPO. PPO's core innovation lies in its unique "Clipping" mechanism, which judiciously limits the magnitude of policy updates, thereby guaranteeing a stable and secure learning process. Furthermore, PPO leverages advanced techniques such as Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE) for more accurate value assessment, incorporates an entropy bonus to encourage exploration, and allows for multiple iterations of data utilization, all of which collectively boost its sample efficiency and overall robustness. This remarkable ability to strike an optimal balance among stability, ease of implementation, and sample efficiency has propelled PPO to become one of the most widely adopted and influential reinforcement learning algorithms across both academic research and industrial applications. It undeniably marks a pivotal advancement in the trajectory of policy gradient algorithms.</p>

                <p class="summary">Existing digital human models, while capable of generating fluid animations, often fall short in capturing the essence of characters due to a lack of deep understanding of emotions, intentions, and context. ByteDance's OmniHuman-1.5 framework addresses this limitation by aiming to produce physically plausible, semantically coherent, and highly expressive character animations. Its core innovations lie in two aspects: first, leveraging Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLM) to generate structured conditional text representations, providing high-level semantic guidance that transcends simple rhythm synchronization; second, introducing a specialized Multi-modal DiT architecture with a novel Pseudo Last Frame design. This design facilitates efficient multi-modal signal fusion and mitigates cross-modal conflicts, enabling the model to accurately comprehend the joint semantics of audio, image, and text. The framework employs a dual-system simulation approach, combining a deliberative System 2 (planning via MLLM Agent) with a reactive System 1 (rendering via MMDiT network), ensuring high consistency across character, scene, and language content, thereby moving towards digital humans with 'thinking' capabilities.</p>

                <p class="summary">A joint survey paper by 20 leading universities, including Princeton and Tsinghua, introduces the concept of "self-evolving agents," emphasizing the critical role of adaptability and adjustment for AI systems in dynamic environments to achieve Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). The review proposes a four-dimensional analytical framework‚ÄîWhat, When, How, and Where to evolve‚Äîsystematically dissecting the evolvable components of agents, including model parameters, context, tools, and architecture. The paper elaborates on two evolution timings: in-task immediate evolution and post-task retrospective learning, alongside three driving forces: feedback, demonstration, and population-based evolution. Self-evolving agents show broad application prospects as general digital assistants and in specialized domains like coding, finance, and healthcare. Future evaluation metrics must focus on adaptability, knowledge retention, generalization, and safety efficiency. This research signals that the next generation of AI will be "intelligent life" capable of co-growth with users, moving beyond static tools.</p>

                <p class="summary">This paper identifies and analyzes a novel vulnerability class in Model
Context Protocol (MCP) based agent systems. The attack chain describes and
demonstrates how benign, individually authorized tasks can be orchestrated to
produce harmful emergent behaviors. Through systematic analysis using the MITRE
ATLAS framework, we demonstrate how 95 agents tested with access to multiple
services-including browser automation, financial analysis, location tracking,
and code deployment-can chain legitimate operations into sophisticated attack
sequences that extend beyond the security boundaries of any individual service.
These red team exercises survey whether current MCP architectures lack
cross-domain security measures necessary to detect or prevent a large category
of compositional attacks. We present empirical evidence of specific attack
chains that achieve targeted harm through service orchestration, including data
exfiltration, financial manipulation, and infrastructure compromise. These
findings reveal that the fundamental security assumption of service isolation
fails when agents can coordinate actions across multiple domains, creating an
exponential attack surface that grows with each additional capability. This
research provides a barebones experimental framework that evaluate not whether
agents can complete MCP benchmark tasks, but what happens when they complete
them too well and optimize across multiple services in ways that violate human
expectations and safety constraints. We propose three concrete experimental
directions using the existing MCP benchmark suite.</p>

  Inference Efficiency with Heuristic Tree-based Modeling">
                <p class="summary">Recent advancements in aligning large language models via reinforcement
learning have achieved remarkable gains in solving complex reasoning problems,
but at the cost of expensive on-policy rollouts and limited exploration of
diverse reasoning paths. In this work, we introduce TreePO, involving a
self-guided rollout algorithm that views sequence generation as a
tree-structured searching process. Composed of dynamic tree sampling policy and
fixed-length segment decoding, TreePO leverages local uncertainty to warrant
additional branches. By amortizing computation across common prefixes and
pruning low-value paths early, TreePO essentially reduces the per-update
compute burden while preserving or enhancing exploration diversity. Key
contributions include: (1) a segment-wise sampling algorithm that alleviates
the KV cache burden through contiguous segments and spawns new branches along
with an early-stop mechanism; (2) a tree-based segment-level advantage
estimation that considers both global and local proximal policy optimization.
and (3) analysis on the effectiveness of probability and quality-driven dynamic
divergence and fallback strategy. We empirically validate the performance gain
of TreePO on a set reasoning benchmarks and the efficiency saving of GPU hours
from 22\% up to 43\% of the sampling design for the trained models, meanwhile
showing up to 40\% reduction at trajectory-level and 35\% at token-level
sampling compute for the existing models. While offering a free lunch of
inference efficiency, TreePO reveals a practical path toward scaling RL-based
post-training with fewer samples and less compute. Home page locates at

  Simulation">
                <p class="summary">Existing video avatar models can produce fluid human animations, yet they
struggle to move beyond mere physical likeness to capture a character's
authentic essence. Their motions typically synchronize with low-level cues like
audio rhythm, lacking a deeper semantic understanding of emotion, intent, or
context. To bridge this gap, we propose a framework designed to
generate character animations that are not only physically plausible but also
semantically coherent and expressive. Our model, OmniHuman-1.5, is
built upon two key technical contributions. First, we leverage Multimodal Large
Language Models to synthesize a structured textual representation of conditions
that provides high-level semantic guidance. This guidance steers our motion
generator beyond simplistic rhythmic synchronization, enabling the production
of actions that are contextually and emotionally resonant. Second, to ensure
the effective fusion of these multimodal inputs and mitigate inter-modality
conflicts, we introduce a specialized Multimodal DiT architecture with a novel
Pseudo Last Frame design. The synergy of these components allows our model to
accurately interpret the joint semantics of audio, images, and text, thereby
generating motions that are deeply coherent with the character, scene, and
linguistic content. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model achieves
leading performance across a comprehensive set of metrics, including lip-sync
accuracy, video quality, motion naturalness and semantic consistency with
textual prompts. Furthermore, our approach shows remarkable extensibility to
complex scenarios, such as those involving multi-person and non-human subjects.

                <img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2508.15774.png" alt="CineScale: Free Lunch in High-Resolution Cinematic Visual Generation">
                <p class="summary">Visual diffusion models achieve remarkable progress, yet they are typically
trained at limited resolutions due to the lack of high-resolution data and
constrained computation resources, hampering their ability to generate
high-fidelity images or videos at higher resolutions. Recent efforts have
explored tuning-free strategies to exhibit the untapped potential
higher-resolution visual generation of pre-trained models. However, these
methods are still prone to producing low-quality visual content with repetitive
patterns. The key obstacle lies in the inevitable increase in high-frequency
information when the model generates visual content exceeding its training
resolution, leading to undesirable repetitive patterns deriving from the
accumulated errors. In this work, we propose CineScale, a novel inference
paradigm to enable higher-resolution visual generation. To tackle the various
issues introduced by the two types of video generation architectures, we
propose dedicated variants tailored to each. Unlike existing baseline methods
that are confined to high-resolution T2I and T2V generation, CineScale broadens
the scope by enabling high-resolution I2V and V2V synthesis, built atop
state-of-the-art open-source video generation frameworks. Extensive experiments
validate the superiority of our paradigm in extending the capabilities of
higher-resolution visual generation for both image and video models.
Remarkably, our approach enables 8k image generation without any fine-tuning,
and achieves 4k video generation with only minimal LoRA fine-tuning. Generated
video samples are available at our website:

                <p class="summary">Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities when
trained within executable runtime environments, notably excelling at software
engineering tasks through verified feedback loops. Yet, scalable and
generalizable execution-grounded environments remain scarce, limiting progress
in training more capable ML agents. We introduce CTF-Dojo, the first
large-scale executable runtime tailored for training LLMs with verifiable
feedback, featuring 658 fully functional Capture-The-Flag (CTF)-style
challenges containerized in Docker with guaranteed reproducibility. To enable
rapid scaling without manual intervention, we develop CTF-Forge, an automated
pipeline that transforms publicly available artifacts into ready-to-use
execution environments in minutes, eliminating weeks of expert configuration
traditionally required. We trained LLM-based agents on just 486 high-quality,
execution-verified trajectories from CTF-Dojo, achieving up to 11.6% absolute
gains over strong baselines across three competitive benchmarks: InterCode-CTF,
NYU CTF Bench, and Cybench. Our best-performing 32B model reaches 31.9% Pass@1,
establishing a new open-weight state-of-the-art that rivals frontier models
like DeepSeek-V3-0324 and Gemini-2.5-Flash. By framing CTF-style tasks as a
benchmark for executable-agent learning, CTF-Dojo demonstrates that
execution-grounded training signals are not only effective but pivotal in
advancing high-performance ML agents without dependence on costly proprietary
systems.</p>

  Long-Context Learning</h2>

  Long-Context Learning">
                <p class="summary">While Mixture of Experts (MoE) models achieve remarkable efficiency by
activating only subsets of parameters, they suffer from high memory access
costs during inference. Memory-layer architectures offer an appealing
alternative with very few memory access, but previous attempts like UltraMem
have only matched the performance of 2-expert MoE models, falling significantly
short of state-of-the-art 8-expert configurations. We present UltraMemV2, a
redesigned memory-layer architecture that closes this performance gap. Our
approach introduces five key improvements: integrating memory layers into every
transformer block, simplifying value expansion with single linear projections,
adopting FFN-based value processing from PEER, implementing principled
parameter initialization, and rebalancing memory-to-FFN computation ratios.
Through extensive evaluation, we demonstrate that UltraMemV2 achieves
performance parity with 8-expert MoE models under same computation and
parameters but significantly low memory access. Notably, UltraMemV2 shows
superior performance on memory-intensive tasks, with improvements of +1.6
points on long-context memorization, +6.2 points on multi-round memorization,
and +7.9 points on in-context learning. We validate our approach at scale with
models up to 2.5B activated parameters from 120B total parameters, and
establish that activation density has greater impact on performance than total
sparse parameter count. Our work brings memory-layer architectures to
performance parity with state-of-the-art MoE models, presenting a compelling
alternative for efficient sparse computation.</p>
