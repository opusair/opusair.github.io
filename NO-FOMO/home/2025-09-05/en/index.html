                <p class="summary">Researchers from Oxford University have introduced VMem (Surfel-Indexed View Memory), a novel approach designed to address the challenges of inconsistency and high computational costs in long video generation. VMem tackles these issues by explicitly recording "what has been seen" into geometric surfels. Instead of relying solely on recent frames, it leverages geometric visibility to retrieve the most relevant historical views as context for subsequent generation. This method significantly enhances consistency in long-sequence video generation, particularly excelling in loop-trajectory evaluations. Furthermore, VMem drastically reduces computational overhead, achieving up to a 12-fold increase in inference speed. As an explicit, interpretable external memory mechanism, VMem offers an efficient and stable solution for long video generation, capable of being plug-and-play integrated into existing backbone networks.</p>

                <p class="summary">The success of powerful open source Large Language Models (LLMs) has enabled
the community to create a vast collection of post-trained models adapted to
specific tasks and domains. However, navigating and understanding these models
remains challenging due to inconsistent metadata and unstructured repositories.
We introduce Delta Activations, a method to represent finetuned models as
vector embeddings by measuring shifts in their internal activations relative to
a base model. This representation allows for effective clustering by domain and
task, revealing structure in the model landscape. Delta Activations also
demonstrate desirable properties: it is robust across finetuning settings and
exhibits an additive property when finetuning datasets are mixed. In addition,
we show that Delta Activations can embed tasks via few-shot finetuning, and
further explore its use for model selection and merging. We hope Delta
Activations can facilitate the practice of reusing publicly available models.

                <p class="summary">We present Durian, the first method for generating portrait animation videos
with facial attribute transfer from a given reference image to a target
portrait in a zero-shot manner. To enable high-fidelity and spatially
consistent attribute transfer across frames, we introduce dual reference
networks that inject spatial features from both the portrait and attribute
images into the denoising process of a diffusion model. We train the model
using a self-reconstruction formulation, where two frames are sampled from the
same portrait video: one is treated as the attribute reference and the other as
the target portrait, and the remaining frames are reconstructed conditioned on
these inputs and their corresponding masks. To support the transfer of
attributes with varying spatial extent, we propose a mask expansion strategy
using keypoint-conditioned image generation for training. In addition, we
further augment the attribute and portrait images with spatial and
appearance-level transformations to improve robustness to positional
misalignment between them. These strategies allow the model to effectively
generalize across diverse attributes and in-the-wild reference combinations,
despite being trained without explicit triplet supervision. Durian achieves
state-of-the-art performance on portrait animation with attribute transfer, and
notably, its dual reference design enables multi-attribute composition in a
single generation pass without additional training.</p>

                <img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2509.04419.png" alt="Towards a Unified View of Large Language Model Post-Training">
                <p class="summary">Two major sources of training data exist for post-training modern language
models: online (model-generated rollouts) data, and offline (human or
other-model demonstrations) data. These two types of data are typically used by
approaches like Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT),
respectively. In this paper, we show that these approaches are not in
contradiction, but are instances of a single optimization process. We derive a
Unified Policy Gradient Estimator, and present the calculations of a wide
spectrum of post-training approaches as the gradient of a common objective
under different data distribution assumptions and various bias-variance
tradeoffs. The gradient estimator is constructed with four interchangeable
parts: stabilization mask, reference policy denominator, advantage estimate,
and likelihood gradient. Motivated by our theoretical findings, we propose
Hybrid Post-Training (HPT), an algorithm that dynamically selects different
training signals. HPT is designed to yield both effective exploitation of
demonstration and stable exploration without sacrificing learned reasoning
patterns. We provide extensive experiments and ablation studies to verify the
effectiveness of our unified theoretical framework and HPT. Across six
mathematical reasoning benchmarks and two out-of-distribution suites, HPT
consistently surpasses strong baselines across models of varying scales and
families.</p>

                <h2>Few-step Flow for 3D Generation via Marginal-Data Transport Distillation</h2>
                <span class="published-time">Published: 2025-09-04T17:24:31.000Z</span>
                <img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2509.04406.png" alt="Few-step Flow for 3D Generation via Marginal-Data Transport Distillation">
                <p class="summary">Flow-based 3D generation models typically require dozens of sampling steps
during inference. Though few-step distillation methods, particularly
Consistency Models (CMs), have achieved substantial advancements in
accelerating 2D diffusion models, they remain under-explored for more complex
3D generation tasks. In this study, we propose a novel framework, MDT-dist, for
few-step 3D flow distillation. Our approach is built upon a primary objective:
distilling the pretrained model to learn the Marginal-Data Transport. Directly
learning this objective needs to integrate the velocity fields, while this
integral is intractable to be implemented. Therefore, we propose two
optimizable objectives, Velocity Matching (VM) and Velocity Distillation (VD),
to equivalently convert the optimization target from the transport level to the
velocity and the distribution level respectively. Velocity Matching (VM) learns
to stably match the velocity fields between the student and the teacher, but
inevitably provides biased gradient estimates. Velocity Distillation (VD)
further enhances the optimization process by leveraging the learned velocity
fields to perform probability density distillation. When evaluated on the
pioneer 3D generation framework TRELLIS, our method reduces sampling steps of
each flow transformer from 25 to 1 or 2, achieving 0.68s (1 step x 2) and 0.94s
(2 steps x 2) latency with 9.0x and 6.5x speedup on A800, while preserving high
visual and geometric fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method significantly outperforms existing CM distillation methods, and enables
TRELLIS to achieve superior performance in few-step 3D generation.</p>

                <p class="summary">Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown that their
reasoning capabilities can be significantly improved through Reinforcement
Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR), particularly in domains like
mathematics and programming, where ground-truth correctness can be
automatically evaluated. However, extending this success to other
reasoning-intensive domains remains challenging due to the scarcity of
high-quality, verifiable datasets and the high cost of human supervision. In
this work, we introduce the Loong Project: an open-source framework for
scalable synthetic data generation and verification across a diverse range of
reasoning-intensive domains. The framework consists of two key components: (1)
LoongBench, a curated seed dataset containing 8,729 human-vetted examples
across 12 domains (e.g., Advanced Mathematics, Chemistry, Logic), each paired
with executable code and rich metadata; and (2) LoongEnv, a modular synthetic
data generation environment that supports multiple prompting strategies to
produce new question-answer-code triples. Together, these components form an
agent-environment loop that enables reinforcement learning, where an LLM-based
agent is rewarded for generating Chain-of-Thought (CoT) solutions that align
with code-executed answers. Empirically, we benchmark LoongBench on a broad
suite of both open-source and proprietary LLMs to evaluate domain coverage and
reveal performance bottlenecks. In addition, we conduct a comprehensive
analysis of synthetic data generated by LoongEnv, examining correctness,
difficulty, and diversity. Code and documentation are available at
https://github.com/camel-ai/loong.</p>

                <p class="summary">Deep research agents have attracted growing attention for their potential to
orchestrate multi-stage research workflows, spanning literature synthesis,
methodological design, and empirical verification. Despite these strides,
evaluating their research capability faithfully is rather challenging due to
the difficulty of collecting frontier research questions that genuinely capture
researchers' attention and intellectual curiosity. To address this gap, we
introduce DeepResearch Arena, a benchmark grounded in academic seminars that
capture rich expert discourse and interaction, better reflecting real-world
research environments and reducing the risk of data leakage. To automatically
construct DeepResearch Arena, we propose a Multi-Agent Hierarchical Task
Generation (MAHTG) system that extracts research-worthy inspirations from
seminar transcripts. The MAHTG system further translates research-worthy
inspirations into high-quality research tasks, ensuring the traceability of
research task formulation while filtering noise. With the MAHTG system, we
curate DeepResearch Arena with over 10,000 high-quality research tasks from
over 200 academic seminars, spanning 12 disciplines, such as literature,
history, and science. Our extensive evaluation shows that DeepResearch Arena
presents substantial challenges for current state-of-the-art agents, with clear
performance gaps observed across different models.</p>
