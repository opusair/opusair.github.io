                <h2>Program-of-Thought Prompting Outperforms Chain-of-Thought by 15%</h2>
                <span class="published-time">Published: 2025-11-30 18:34:52</span>
                
                <p class="summary">A novel prompting technique, Program-of-Thought (PoT) prompting, has demonstrated a significant performance improvement of 15% over the widely adopted Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting method. This research introduces PoT as an innovative approach where large language models are guided to express their intermediate reasoning steps in a structured programming language, rather than conventional natural language. By leveraging the formal syntax, logical constructs, and inherent compositionality of programming paradigms, PoT facilitates more systematic, modular, and verifiable reasoning processes. This structured format offers several advantages, including explicit function definitions, parameter passing, and conditional logic, which enhance the model's capability to decompose and solve complex, multi-step problems more effectively. The improved performance observed across various tasks suggests that instructing LLMs with programmatic steps can unlock superior symbolic reasoning abilities, enable robust error correction, and lead to more accurate and explainable outputs, representing a substantial advancement in the field of prompt engineering and cognitive architectures for AI models.</p>

                <p class="summary">This article, titled "Writing a Good Claude.md," delves into best practices for crafting effective and clear interactions with AI models, particularly focusing on Anthropic's Claude. It emphasizes the importance of structured prompting, suggesting the use of Markdown (.md) to organize instructions, examples, and contextual information within prompts. Key recommendations include defining the AI's persona and task clearly, breaking down complex requests into smaller, manageable steps, and providing relevant background data to guide the model's responses. The discussion likely covers techniques for precise language, avoiding ambiguity, and iterating on prompts to refine output quality. By adopting a methodical approach to prompt engineering, users can significantly enhance Claude's performance, ensuring more accurate, relevant, and consistently high-quality generated content, whether for code, creative writing, or analytical tasks. The core idea revolves around transforming natural language instructions into a robust, machine-interpretable format to unlock the full potential of large language models.</p>

                <span class="published-time">Published: 2025-11-30 13:40:09</span>
                
                <p class="summary">The Norway wealth fund, one of the world's largest sovereign wealth funds and a significant institutional investor in Microsoft, has publicly announced its intention to vote in favor of a human rights report at Microsoft's upcoming Annual General Meeting. This decision simultaneously signals a vote against the current management, including CEO Satya Nadella. While the core of this matter addresses corporate governance and the critical issue of human rights accountability, it carries substantial implications for a leading global technology company such as Microsoft. In an era where tech giants face increasing scrutiny over ethical AI development, data privacy practices, and their global operational footprint, investor pressure on non-financial performance indicators like ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) is intensifying. This move by a major shareholder could influence Microsoft's strategic integration of human rights considerations into its product development cycles, supply chain management, and worldwide operations, potentially affecting its reputation and long-term sustainability within the highly competitive technology landscape. The emphasis on human rights reports reflects a growing demand for greater transparency and ethical oversight in the design and deployment of technology globally, indicating a broader trend among investors advocating for responsible technology practices across the industry.</p>

                <p class="summary">The Agent Development Kit (ADK) for Go is an open-source, code-first toolkit developed by Google for building, evaluating, and deploying sophisticated AI agents. This flexible and modular framework applies software development principles to AI agent creation, simplifying the orchestration of workflows from simple tasks to complex systems. ADK is notably model-agnostic and deployment-agnostic, ensuring compatibility beyond its optimization for Google's Gemini models.Tailored for cloud-native applications, the Go version of ADK leverages Go's strengths in concurrency and performance. Its key features include an idiomatic Go design, a rich tool ecosystem for integrating custom or pre-built functions, and a code-first development approach enhancing flexibility, testability, and versioning. ADK facilitates the design of modular multi-agent systems for scalable applications and supports easy containerization and deployment, particularly in cloud-native environments like Google Cloud Run. This makes it an ideal choice for developers aiming for robust, high-performance agent solutions.</p>
