                <p class="summary">Microsoft introduces a novel paradigm called "Reinforcement Pre-Training (RPT)," which redefines the next-token prediction task as a reinforcement learning-trained inference process. This innovative approach integrates reinforcement learning directly into the pre-training phase of large language models, allowing models to receive verifiable rewards for accurately predicting the next token within a given context. A key advantage of RPT is its scalability and generality, as it leverages vast amounts of unlabeled text data for universal reinforcement learning without requiring external annotations or domain-specific reward functions. The method significantly enhances language modeling accuracy and provides a robust foundation for subsequent reinforcement fine-tuning, while inherently minimizing reward hacking risks. Experimental results demonstrate that RPT consistently outperforms baseline models in next-token prediction accuracy and zero-shot performance, even matching larger models. This research highlights RPT's substantial potential to advance large language model pre-training by fostering deeper understanding and generalization beyond mere token association, marking a significant shift in the "next-token" paradigm.</p>

countries though an analysis of their interpretation of historical events with
conflicting national perspectives (USA, UK, USSR, and China). We introduce a
novel dataset with neutral event descriptions and contrasting viewpoints from
different countries. Our findings show significant geopolitical biases, with
models favoring specific national narratives. Additionally, simple debiasing
prompts had a limited effect in reducing these biases. Experiments with
manipulated participant labels reveal models' sensitivity to attribution,
sometimes amplifying biases or recognizing inconsistencies, especially with
swapped labels. This work highlights national narrative biases in LLMs,
challenges the effectiveness of simple debiasing methods, and offers a
framework and dataset for future geopolitical bias research.</p>

  Better">
                <p class="summary">Typical large vision-language models (LVLMs) apply autoregressive supervision
solely to textual sequences, without fully incorporating the visual modality
into the learning process. This results in three key limitations: (1) an
inability to utilize images without accompanying captions, (2) the risk that
captions omit critical visual details, and (3) the challenge that certain
vision-centric content cannot be adequately conveyed through text. As a result,
current LVLMs often prioritize vision-to-language alignment while potentially
overlooking fine-grained visual information. While some prior works have
explored autoregressive image generation, effectively leveraging autoregressive
visual supervision to enhance image understanding remains an open challenge. In
this paper, we introduce Autoregressive Semantic Visual Reconstruction (ASVR),
which enables joint learning of visual and textual modalities within a unified
autoregressive framework. We show that autoregressively reconstructing the raw
visual appearance of images does not enhance and may even impair multimodal
understanding. In contrast, autoregressively reconstructing the semantic
representation of images consistently improves comprehension. Notably, we find
that even when models are given continuous image features as input, they can
effectively reconstruct discrete semantic tokens, resulting in stable and
consistent improvements across a wide range of multimodal understanding
benchmarks. Our approach delivers significant performance gains across varying
data scales (556k-2M) and types of LLM bacbones. Specifically, ASVR improves
LLaVA-1.5 by 5% in average scores across 14 multimodal benchmarks. The code is

                <p class="summary">From professional filmmaking to user-generated content, creators and
consumers have long recognized that the power of video depends on the
harmonious integration of what we hear (the video's audio track) with what we
see (the video's image sequence). Current approaches to video generation either
ignore sound to focus on general-purpose but silent image sequence generation
or address both visual and audio elements but focus on restricted application
domains such as re-dubbing. We introduce Mirage, an audio-to-video foundation
model that excels at generating realistic, expressive output imagery from
scratch given an audio input. When integrated with existing methods for speech
synthesis (text-to-speech, or TTS), Mirage results in compelling multimodal
video. When trained on audio-video footage of people talking (A-roll) and
conditioned on audio containing speech, Mirage generates video of people
delivering a believable interpretation of the performance implicit in input
audio. Our central technical contribution is a unified method for training
self-attention-based audio-to-video generation models, either from scratch or
given existing weights. This methodology allows Mirage to retain generality as
an approach to audio-to-video generation while producing outputs of superior
subjective quality to methods that incorporate audio-specific architectures or
loss components specific to people, speech, or details of how images or audio
are captured. We encourage readers to watch and listen to the results of Mirage
for themselves (see paper and comments for links).</p>

                <h2>ECoRAG: Evidentiality-guided Compression for Long Context RAG</h2>
                <span class="published-time">Published: 2025-06-05T15:43:49.000Z</span>
                <img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2506.05167.png" alt="ECoRAG: Evidentiality-guided Compression for Long Context RAG">
                <p class="summary">Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance in Open-Domain
Question Answering (ODQA) by leveraging external documents through
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). To reduce RAG overhead, from longer
context, context compression is necessary. However, prior compression methods
do not focus on filtering out non-evidential information, which limit the
performance in LLM-based RAG. We thus propose Evidentiality-guided RAG, or
ECoRAG framework. ECoRAG improves LLM performance by compressing retrieved
documents based on evidentiality, ensuring whether answer generation is
supported by the correct evidence. As an additional step, ECoRAG reflects
whether the compressed content provides sufficient evidence, and if not,
retrieves more until sufficient. Experiments show that ECoRAG improves LLM
performance on ODQA tasks, outperforming existing compression methods.
Furthermore, ECoRAG is highly cost-efficient, as it not only reduces latency
but also minimizes token usage by retaining only the necessary information to
generate the correct answer. Code is available at
https://github.com/ldilab/ECoRAG.</p>

  Reasoning in MLLMs">
                <p class="summary">The rapid advancement of image generation technologies intensifies the demand
for interpretable and robust detection methods. Although existing approaches
often attain high accuracy, they typically operate as black boxes without
providing human-understandable justifications. Multi-modal Large Language
Models (MLLMs), while not originally intended for forgery detection, exhibit
strong analytical and reasoning capabilities. When properly fine-tuned, they
can effectively identify AI-generated images and offer meaningful explanations.
However, existing MLLMs still struggle with hallucination and often fail to
align their visual interpretations with actual image content and human
reasoning. To bridge this gap, we construct a dataset of AI-generated images
annotated with bounding boxes and descriptive captions that highlight synthesis
artifacts, establishing a foundation for human-aligned visual-textual grounded
reasoning. We then finetune MLLMs through a multi-stage optimization strategy
that progressively balances the objectives of accurate detection, visual
localization, and coherent textual explanation. The resulting model achieves
superior performance in both detecting AI-generated images and localizing
visual flaws, significantly outperforming baseline methods.</p>

                <h2>Thinking vs. Doing: Agents that Reason by Scaling Test-Time Interaction</h2>

                <img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2506.07976.png" alt="Thinking vs. Doing: Agents that Reason by Scaling Test-Time Interaction">
                <p class="summary">The current paradigm of test-time scaling relies on generating long reasoning
traces ("thinking" more) before producing a response. In agent problems that
require interaction, this can be done by generating thinking traces before
acting in the world. However, this process does not allow agents to acquire new
information from the environment or adapt their behavior over time. In this
work, we propose to scale test-time interaction, an untapped dimension of
test-time scaling that increases the agent's interaction horizon to enable
running rich behaviors such as exploration, backtracking, and dynamic
re-planning within a single rollout. To demonstrate the promise of this scaling
dimension, we study the domain of web agents. We first show that even
prompting-based interaction scaling without any training can improve task
success on web benchmarks non-trivially. Building on this, we introduce TTI
(Test-Time Interaction), a curriculum-based online reinforcement learning (RL)
approach that trains agents by adaptively adjusting their rollout lengths.
Using a Gemma 3 12B model, TTI produces state-of-the-art open-source, open-data
web agents on WebVoyager and WebArena benchmarks. We further show that TTI
enables agents to balance exploration and exploitation adaptively. Our results
establish interaction scaling as a powerful, complementary axis to scaling
per-step compute, offering new avenues for training adaptive agents.</p>
