This innovative approach integrates reinforcement learning directly into the pre-training phase of large language models, allowing models to receive verifiable rewards for accurately predicting the next token within a given context. A key advantage of RPT is its scalability and generality, as it leverages vast amounts of unlabeled text data for universal reinforcement learning without requiring external annotations or domain-specific reward functions. The method significantly enhances language modeling accuracy and provides a robust foundation for subsequent reinforcement fine-tuning, while inherently minimizing reward hacking risks. Experimental results demonstrate that RPT consistently outperforms baseline models in next-token prediction accuracy and zero-shot performance, even matching larger models. This research highlights RPT's substantial potential to advance large language model pre-training by fostering deeper understanding and generalization beyond mere token association, marking a significant shift in the \"next-token\" paradigm.",

    "title_en": "Autoregressive Semantic Visual Reconstruction Helps VLMs Understand\n  Better",
    "summary_en": "Typical large vision-language models (LVLMs) apply autoregressive supervision\nsolely to textual sequences, without fully incorporating the visual modality\ninto the learning process. This results in three key limitations: (1) an\ninability to utilize images without accompanying captions, (2) the risk that\ncaptions omit critical visual details, and (3) the challenge that certain\nvision-centric content cannot be adequately conveyed through text. As a result,\ncurrent LVLMs often prioritize vision-to-language alignment while potentially\noverlooking fine-grained visual information. While some prior works have\nexplored autoregressive image generation, effectively leveraging autoregressive\nvisual supervision to enhance image understanding remains an open challenge. In\nthis paper, we introduce Autoregressive Semantic Visual Reconstruction (ASVR),\nwhich enables joint learning of visual and textual modalities within a unified\nautoregressive framework. We show that autoregressively reconstructing the raw\nvisual appearance of images does not enhance and may even impair multimodal\nunderstanding. In contrast, autoregressively reconstructing the semantic\nrepresentation of images consistently improves comprehension. Notably, we find\nthat even when models are given continuous image features as input, they can\neffectively reconstruct discrete semantic tokens, resulting in stable and\nconsistent improvements across a wide range of multimodal understanding\nbenchmarks. Our approach delivers significant performance gains across varying\ndata scales (556k-2M) and types of LLM bacbones. Specifically, ASVR improves\nLLaVA-1.5 by 5% in average scores across 14 multimodal benchmarks. The code is\navailable at https://github.com/AlenjandroWang/ASVR.",

    "summary_en": "From professional filmmaking to user-generated content, creators and\nconsumers have long recognized that the power of video depends on the\nharmonious integration of what we hear (the video's audio track) with what we\nsee (the video's image sequence). Current approaches to video generation either\nignore sound to focus on general-purpose but silent image sequence generation\nor address both visual and audio elements but focus on restricted application\ndomains such as re-dubbing. We introduce Mirage, an audio-to-video foundation\nmodel that excels at generating realistic, expressive output imagery from\nscratch given an audio input. When integrated with existing methods for speech\nsynthesis (text-to-speech, or TTS), Mirage results in compelling multimodal\nvideo. When trained on audio-video footage of people talking (A-roll) and\nconditioned on audio containing speech, Mirage generates video of people\ndelivering a believable interpretation of the performance implicit in input\naudio. Our central technical contribution is a unified method for training\nself-attention-based audio-to-video generation models, either from scratch or\ngiven existing weights. This methodology allows Mirage to retain generality as\nan approach to audio-to-video generation while producing outputs of superior\nsubjective quality to methods that incorporate audio-specific architectures or\nloss components specific to people, speech, or details of how images or audio\nare captured. We encourage readers to watch and listen to the results of Mirage\nfor themselves (see paper and comments for links).",

As an additional step, ECoRAG reflects\nwhether the compressed content provides sufficient evidence, and if not,\nretrieves more until sufficient. Experiments show that ECoRAG improves LLM\nperformance on ODQA tasks, outperforming existing compression methods.\nFurthermore, ECoRAG is highly cost-efficient, as it not only reduces latency\nbut also minimizes token usage by retaining only the necessary information to\ngenerate the correct answer.

Multi-modal Large Language\nModels (MLLMs), while not originally intended for forgery detection, exhibit\nstrong analytical and reasoning capabilities. When properly fine-tuned, they\ncan effectively identify AI-generated images and offer meaningful explanations.\nHowever, existing MLLMs still struggle with hallucination and often fail to\nalign their visual interpretations with actual image content and human\nreasoning. To bridge this gap, we construct a dataset of AI-generated images\nannotated with bounding boxes and descriptive captions that highlight synthesis\nartifacts, establishing a foundation for human-aligned visual-textual grounded\nreasoning. We then finetune MLLMs through a multi-stage optimization strategy\nthat progressively balances the objectives of accurate detection, visual\nlocalization, and coherent textual explanation.

    "summary_en": "The current paradigm of test-time scaling relies on generating long reasoning\ntraces (\"thinking\" more) before producing a response. In agent problems that\nrequire interaction, this can be done by generating thinking traces before\nacting in the world. However, this process does not allow agents to acquire new\ninformation from the environment or adapt their behavior over time. In this\nwork, we propose to scale test-time interaction, an untapped dimension of\ntest-time scaling that increases the agent's interaction horizon to enable\nrunning rich behaviors such as exploration, backtracking, and dynamic\nre-planning within a single rollout. To demonstrate the promise of this scaling\ndimension, we study the domain of web agents. We first show that even\nprompting-based interaction scaling without any training can improve task\nsuccess on web benchmarks non-trivially. Building on this, we introduce TTI\n(Test-Time Interaction), a curriculum-based online reinforcement learning (RL)\napproach that trains agents by adaptively adjusting their rollout lengths.\nUsing a Gemma 3 12B model, TTI produces state-of-the-art open-source, open-data\nweb agents on WebVoyager and WebArena benchmarks. We further show that TTI\nenables agents to balance exploration and exploitation adaptively.
