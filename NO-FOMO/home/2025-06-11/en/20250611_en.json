Recent studies have shown that\nlarge reasoning models (LRMs) have remarkable reasoning capabilities, and their\nperformance is substantially enhanced by reinforcement learning (RL). However,\nit remains an open question whether small reasoning models (SRMs) can learn\nrule-based reasoning effectively with robust generalization across diverse\ntasks and domains. To address this, we introduce Reinforced Rule-based\nReasoning, a.k.a.

Specifically, RuleReasoner resamples\neach training batch by updating the sampling weights of different domains based\non historical rewards. This facilitates domain augmentation and flexible online\nlearning schedules for RL, obviating the need for pre-hoc human-engineered\nmix-training recipes used in existing methods. Empirical evaluations on\nin-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) benchmarks reveal that\nRuleReasoner outperforms frontier LRMs by a significant margin (Delta4.1%\naverage points on eight ID tasks and Delta10.4% average points on three OOD\ntasks over OpenAI-o1).

    "summary_en": "Typical large vision-language models (LVLMs) apply autoregressive supervision\nsolely to textual sequences, without fully incorporating the visual modality\ninto the learning process. This results in three key limitations: (1) an\ninability to utilize images without accompanying captions, (2) the risk that\ncaptions omit critical visual details, and (3) the challenge that certain\nvision-centric content cannot be adequately conveyed through text. As a result,\ncurrent LVLMs often prioritize vision-to-language alignment while potentially\noverlooking fine-grained visual information. While some prior works have\nexplored autoregressive image generation, effectively leveraging autoregressive\nvisual supervision to enhance image understanding remains an open challenge. In\nthis paper, we introduce Autoregressive Semantic Visual Reconstruction (ASVR),\nwhich enables joint learning of visual and textual modalities within a unified\nautoregressive framework. We show that autoregressively reconstructing the raw\nvisual appearance of images does not enhance and may even impair multimodal\nunderstanding. In contrast, autoregressively reconstructing the semantic\nrepresentation of images consistently improves comprehension. Notably, we find\nthat even when models are given continuous image features as input, they can\neffectively reconstruct discrete semantic tokens, resulting in stable and\nconsistent improvements across a wide range of multimodal understanding\nbenchmarks. Our approach delivers significant performance gains across varying\ndata scales (556k-2M) and types of LLM bacbones. Specifically, ASVR improves\nLLaVA-1.5 by 5% in average scores across 14 multimodal benchmarks. The code is\navailable at https://github.com/AlenjandroWang/ASVR.",

It addresses the longstanding issue of exposure bias, where\nmodels trained on ground-truth context must generate sequences conditioned on\ntheir own imperfect outputs during inference. Unlike prior methods that denoise\nfuture frames based on ground-truth context frames, Self Forcing conditions\neach frame's generation on previously self-generated outputs by performing\nautoregressive rollout with key-value (KV) caching during training. This\nstrategy enables supervision through a holistic loss at the video level that\ndirectly evaluates the quality of the entire generated sequence, rather than\nrelying solely on traditional frame-wise objectives. To ensure training\nefficiency, we employ a few-step diffusion model along with a stochastic\ngradient truncation strategy, effectively balancing computational cost and\nperformance. We further introduce a rolling KV cache mechanism that enables\nefficient autoregressive video extrapolation. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthat our approach achieves real-time streaming video generation with sub-second\nlatency on a single GPU, while matching or even surpassing the generation\nquality of significantly slower and non-causal diffusion models.

In agent problems that\nrequire interaction, this can be done by generating thinking traces before\nacting in the world. However, this process does not allow agents to acquire new\ninformation from the environment or adapt their behavior over time. In this\nwork, we propose to scale test-time interaction, an untapped dimension of\ntest-time scaling that increases the agent's interaction horizon to enable\nrunning rich behaviors such as exploration, backtracking, and dynamic\nre-planning within a single rollout. To demonstrate the promise of this scaling\ndimension, we study the domain of web agents. We first show that even\nprompting-based interaction scaling without any training can improve task\nsuccess on web benchmarks non-trivially. Building on this, we introduce TTI\n(Test-Time Interaction), a curriculum-based online reinforcement learning (RL)\napproach that trains agents by adaptively adjusting their rollout lengths.\nUsing a Gemma 3 12B model, TTI produces state-of-the-art open-source, open-data\nweb agents on WebVoyager and WebArena benchmarks.

    "summary_en": "Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a commonly used approach for\nenhancing large language models (LLMs) with relevant and up-to-date\ninformation. However, the retrieved sources can often contain conflicting\ninformation and it remains unclear how models should address such\ndiscrepancies. In this work, we first propose a novel taxonomy of knowledge\nconflict types in RAG, along with the desired model behavior for each type. We\nthen introduce CONFLICTS, a high-quality benchmark with expert annotations of\nconflict types in a realistic RAG setting. CONFLICTS is the first benchmark\nthat enables tracking progress on how models address a wide range of knowledge\nconflicts. We conduct extensive experiments on this benchmark, showing that\nLLMs often struggle to appropriately resolve conflicts between sources. While\nprompting LLMs to explicitly reason about the potential conflict in the\nretrieved documents significantly improves the quality and appropriateness of\ntheir responses, substantial room for improvement in future research remains.",
