    "summary_en": "Tencent Hunyuan, in collaboration with Peking University, introduces MixGRPO, a novel approach designed to significantly enhance the training efficiency of text-to-image models based on GRPO and Flow Matching. This innovation directly addresses the substantial computational overhead of existing methods like FlowGRPO, which necessitate optimizing all denoising steps. MixGRPO achieves this by employing an innovative ODE-SDE mixed sampling strategy and a dynamic sliding window optimization mechanism. This intelligent approach effectively confines stochastic exploration within a specific window, allowing for the strategic application of high-order ODE solvers to accelerate the process and substantially reduce overall computational complexity. Experimental results conclusively demonstrate that the MixGRPO-Flash variant dramatically slashes training time by up to 71%. Crucially, it maintains or even surpasses the human preference alignment and generation quality achieved by DanceGRPO. As the pioneering Flow Matching generative model to integrate online reinforcement learning, MixGRPO successfully strikes an optimal balance between efficiency and superior performance in generative tasks.",

This paradigm shift promises significant efficiency gains and reduced waiting times for users. While coordinating multiple agents presents inherent challenges, the decreasing cost of large language model tokens makes this approach increasingly viable. The article references recent research, such as \"Code Monkeys\" and Together's Mixture Of Agents (MoA) architecture, which demonstrate the potential of parallel solution generation and leveraging multiple LLMs for performance improvement. Ng emphasizes that substantial research and engineering efforts are still required to optimally utilize parallel agents, asserting their immense potential for efficient collaborative work, akin to human teams. The core principle, he concludes, is \"parallelism.\"",

Experiments conducted within this framework reveal that decentralized \"wolf pack\" collusion proves significantly more dangerous and effective than centralized command structures, enabling the efficient spread of false information and the maximization of illicit gains. Furthermore, when confronted with various defense mechanisms, these malicious agents rapidly evolve their strategies through continuous \"self-reflection\" and \"experience sharing\" within their groups, demonstrating remarkable adaptability and evasion capabilities.

We reveal that this happens\nwhen minimal score differences between images are amplified after\nnormalization, creating illusory advantages that drive the model to\nover-optimize for trivial gains, ultimately destabilizing the image generation\nprocess. To address this, we propose Pref-GRPO, a pairwise preference\nreward-based GRPO method that shifts the optimization objective from score\nmaximization to preference fitting, ensuring more stable training. In\nPref-GRPO, images are pairwise compared within each group using preference RM,\nand the win rate is used as the reward signal. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that PREF-GRPO differentiates subtle image quality differences,\nproviding more stable advantages and mitigating reward hacking. Additionally,\nexisting T2I benchmarks are limited by coarse evaluation criteria, hindering\ncomprehensive model assessment. To solve this, we introduce UniGenBench, a\nunified T2I benchmark comprising 600 prompts across 5 main themes and 20\nsubthemes. It evaluates semantic consistency through 10 primary and 27\nsub-criteria, leveraging MLLM for benchmark construction and evaluation.

    "summary_en": "Safety alignment in Large Language Models (LLMs) often involves mediating\ninternal representations to refuse harmful requests. Recent research has\ndemonstrated that these safety mechanisms can be bypassed by ablating or\nremoving specific representational directions within the model. In this paper,\nwe propose the opposite approach: Rank-One Safety Injection (ROSI), a white-box\nmethod that amplifies a model's safety alignment by permanently steering its\nactivations toward the refusal-mediating subspace. ROSI operates as a simple,\nfine-tuning-free rank-one weight modification applied to all residual stream\nwrite matrices. The required safety direction can be computed from a small set\nof harmful and harmless instruction pairs. We show that ROSI consistently\nincreases safety refusal rates - as evaluated by Llama Guard 3 - while\npreserving the utility of the model on standard benchmarks such as MMLU,\nHellaSwag, and Arc. Furthermore, we show that ROSI can also re-align\n'uncensored' models by amplifying their own latent safety directions,\ndemonstrating its utility as an effective last-mile safety procedure. Our\nresults suggest that targeted, interpretable weight steering is a cheap and\npotent mechanism to improve LLM safety, complementing more resource-intensive\nfine-tuning paradigms.",

    "summary_en": "3D content inherently encompasses multi-modal characteristics and can be\nprojected into different modalities (e.g., RGB images, RGBD, and point clouds).\nEach modality exhibits distinct advantages in 3D asset modeling: RGB images\ncontain vivid 3D textures, whereas point clouds define fine-grained 3D\ngeometries. However, most existing 3D-native generative architectures either\noperate predominantly within single-modality paradigms-thus overlooking the\ncomplementary benefits of multi-modality data-or restrict themselves to 3D\nstructures, thereby limiting the scope of available training datasets. To\nholistically harness multi-modalities for 3D modeling, we present TriMM, the\nfirst feed-forward 3D-native generative model that learns from basic\nmulti-modalities (e.g., RGB, RGBD, and point cloud). Specifically, 1) TriMM\nfirst introduces collaborative multi-modal coding, which integrates\nmodality-specific features while preserving their unique representational\nstrengths. 2) Furthermore, auxiliary 2D and 3D supervision are introduced to\nraise the robustness and performance of multi-modal coding. 3) Based on the\nembedded multi-modal code, TriMM employs a triplane latent diffusion model to\ngenerate 3D assets of superior quality, enhancing both the texture and the\ngeometric detail. Extensive experiments on multiple well-known datasets\ndemonstrate that TriMM, by effectively leveraging multi-modality, achieves\ncompetitive performance with models trained on large-scale datasets, despite\nutilizing a small amount of training data. Furthermore, we conduct additional\nexperiments on recent RGB-D datasets, verifying the feasibility of\nincorporating other multi-modal datasets into 3D generation.",
