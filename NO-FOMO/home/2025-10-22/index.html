                <h2>The security paradox of local LLMs</h2>
                <span class="published-time">Published: 2025-10-22 12:48:01</span>
                
                <p class="summary">The adoption of local Large Language Models (LLMs) presents a significant security paradox, where the perceived privacy benefits of on-device processing are offset by new and complex security challenges. While local LLMs can reduce reliance on third-party cloud services, enhancing data privacy by keeping sensitive information within an organization's control, this paradigm shift necessitates robust internal security infrastructures. Deploying LLMs locally introduces risks such as securing model weights, managing access controls, ensuring data integrity during inference, and safeguarding against supply chain vulnerabilities. Organizations must invest heavily in securing the local environment, including regular updates and sophisticated threat detection, to prevent potential data breaches or model tampering. This inherent trade-off emphasizes that increased data control often translates into a greater, more intricate security responsibility for the end-user or enterprise.</p>

                <h2>Show HN: Incremental JSON parser for streaming LLM tool calls in Ruby</h2>
                <span class="published-time">Published: 2025-10-22 19:32:01</span>
                
                <p class="summary">A new incremental JSON parser has been introduced, specifically designed for efficiently handling streaming Large Language Model (LLM) tool calls in Ruby. Traditional JSON parsers often exhibit O(n) performance by reprocessing the entire JSON string with each new character, leading to noticeable UI lag in real-time AI applications. This innovative parser addresses this limitation by maintaining parsing state and processing only newly received characters, thereby achieving true O(n) performance. This optimization ensures a seamless and imperceptible user experience throughout the LLM's streaming response, preventing delays that would otherwise occur when function arguments are streamed as character-by-character JSON. Released as an MIT-licensed Ruby gem, this tool aims to enhance the responsiveness and efficiency of AI agent interactions by providing a performant solution for parsing incomplete and progressively updated JSON data streams. The developer is actively soliciting feedback from the community.</p>

                <h2>Every Step Evolves: Scaling Reinforcement Learning for Trillion-Scale Thinking Model</h2>
                <span class="published-time">Published: 2025-10-21T17:46:14.000Z</span>
                
                <p class="summary">We present Ring-1T, the first open-source, state-of-the-art thinking model with a trillion-scale parameter. It features 1 trillion total parameters and activates approximately 50 billion per token. Training such models at a trillion-parameter scale introduces unprecedented challenges, including train-inference misalignment, inefficiencies in rollout processing, and bottlenecks in the RL system. To address these, we pioneer three interconnected innovations: (1) IcePop stabilizes RL training via token-level discrepancy masking and clipping, resolving instability from training-inference mismatches; (2) C3PO++ improves resource utilization for long rollouts under a token budget by dynamically partitioning them, thereby obtaining high time efficiency; and (3) ASystem, a high-performance RL framework designed to overcome the systemic bottlenecks that impede trillion-parameter model training. Ring-1T delivers breakthrough results across critical benchmarks: 93.4 on AIME-2025, 86.72 on HMMT-2025, 2088 on CodeForces, and 55.94 on ARC-AGI-v1. Notably, it attains a silver medal-level result on the IMO-2025, underscoring its exceptional reasoning capabilities. By releasing the complete 1T parameter MoE model to the community, we provide the research community with direct access to cutting-edge reasoning capabilities. This contribution marks a significant milestone in democratizing large-scale reasoning intelligence and establishes a new baseline for open-source model performance.</p>

                <h2>Any-Depth Alignment: Unlocking Innate Safety Alignment of LLMs to Any-Depth</h2>
                <span class="published-time">Published: 2025-10-20T20:18:59.000Z</span>
                
                <p class="summary">Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong but shallow alignment: they directly refuse harmful queries when a refusal is expected at the very start of an assistant turn, yet this protection collapses once a harmful continuation is underway (either through the adversarial attacks or via harmful assistant-prefill attacks). This raises a fundamental question: Can the innate shallow alignment in LLMs be unlocked to ensure safety at arbitrary generation depths? To achieve this goal, we propose Any-Depth Alignment (ADA), an effective inference-time defense with negligible overhead. ADA is built based on our observation that alignment is concentrated in the assistant header tokens through repeated use in shallow-refusal training, and these tokens possess the model's strong alignment priors. By reintroducing these tokens mid-stream, ADA induces the model to reassess harmfulness and recover refusals at any point in generation. Across diverse open-source model families (Llama, Gemma, Mistral, Qwen, DeepSeek, and gpt-oss), ADA achieves robust safety performance without requiring any changes to the base model's parameters. It secures a near-100% refusal rate against challenging adversarial prefill attacks ranging from dozens to thousands of tokens. Furthermore, ADA reduces the average success rate of prominent adversarial prompt attacks (such as GCG, AutoDAN, PAIR, and TAP) to below 3%. This is all accomplished while preserving utility on benign tasks with minimal over-refusal. ADA maintains this resilience even after the base model undergoes subsequent instruction tuning (benign or adversarial).</p>

                <h2>UltraGen: High-Resolution Video Generation with Hierarchical Attention</h2>
                <span class="published-time">Published: 2025-10-21T16:23:21.000Z</span>
                
                <p class="summary">Recent advances in video generation have made it possible to produce visually compelling videos, with wide-ranging applications in content creation, entertainment, and virtual reality. However, most existing diffusion transformer based video generation models are limited to low-resolution outputs (<=720P) due to the quadratic computational complexity of the attention mechanism with respect to the output width and height. This computational bottleneck makes native high-resolution video generation (1080P/2K/4K) impractical for both training and inference. To address this challenge, we present UltraGen, a novel video generation framework that enables i) efficient and ii) end-to-end native high-resolution video synthesis. Specifically, UltraGen features a hierarchical dual-branch attention architecture based on global-local attention decomposition, which decouples full attention into a local attention branch for high-fidelity regional content and a global attention branch for overall semantic consistency. We further propose a spatially compressed global modeling strategy to efficiently learn global dependencies, and a hierarchical cross-window local attention mechanism to reduce computational costs while enhancing information flow across different local windows. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UltraGen can effectively scale pre-trained low-resolution video models to 1080P and even 4K resolution for the first time, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods and super-resolution based two-stage pipelines in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations.</p>

                <p class="summary">Generative world models (WMs) can now simulate worlds with striking visual realism, which naturally raises the question of whether they can endow embodied agents with predictive perception for decision making. Progress on this question has been limited by fragmented evaluation: most existing benchmarks adopt open-loop protocols that emphasize visual quality in isolation, leaving the core issue of embodied utility unresolved, i.e., do WMs actually help agents succeed at embodied tasks? To address this gap, we introduce World-in-World, the first open platform that benchmarks WMs in a closed-loop world that mirrors real agent-environment interactions. World-in-World provides a unified online planning strategy and a standardized action API, enabling heterogeneous WMs for decision making. We curate four closed-loop environments that rigorously evaluate diverse WMs, prioritize task success as the primary metric, and move beyond the common focus on visual quality; we also present the first data scaling law for world models in embodied settings. Our study uncovers three surprises: (1) visual quality alone does not guarantee task success, controllability matters more; (2) scaling post-training with action-observation data is more effective than upgrading the pretrained video generators; and (3) allocating more inference-time compute allows WMs to substantially improve closed-loop performance.</p>

                <span class="published-time">Published: 2025-10-21T17:58:17.000Z</span>
                
                <p class="summary">Despite their remarkable capabilities, Large Language Models (LLMs) struggleto effectively leverage historical interaction information in dynamic andcomplex environments. Memory systems enable LLMs to move beyond statelessinteractions by introducing persistent information storage, retrieval, andutilization mechanisms. However, existing memory systems often introducesubstantial time and computational overhead. To this end, we introduce a newmemory system called LightMem, which strikes a balance between the performanceand efficiency of memory systems. Inspired by the Atkinson-Shiffrin model ofhuman memory, LightMem organizes memory into three complementary stages. First,cognition-inspired sensory memory rapidly filters irrelevant informationthrough lightweight compression and groups information according to theirtopics. Next, topic-aware short-term memory consolidates these topic-basedgroups, organizing and summarizing content for more structured access. Finally,long-term memory with sleep-time update employs an offline procedure thatdecouples consolidation from online inference. Experiments on LongMemEval withGPT and Qwen backbones show that LightMem outperforms strong baselines inaccuracy (up to 10.9% gains) while reducing token usage by up to 117x, APIcalls by up to 159x, and runtime by over 12x.

                <p class="summary">Tool-augmented large language models (LLMs) are emerging as deep research agents, systems that decompose complex queries, retrieve external evidence, and synthesize grounded responses. Yet current agents remain limited by shallow retrieval, weak alignment metrics, and brittle tool-use behavior. We introduce PokeeResearch-7B, a 7B-parameter deep research agent built under a unified reinforcement learning framework for robustness, alignment, and scalability. PokeeResearch-7B is trained by an annotation-free Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF) framework to optimize policies using LLM-based reward signals that capture factual accuracy, citation faithfulness, and instruction adherence. A chain-of-thought-driven multi-call reasoning scaffold further enhances robustness through self-verification and adaptive recovery from tool failures. Among 10 popular deep research benchmarks, PokeeResearch-7B achieves state-of-the-art performance among 7B-scale deep research agents. This highlights that careful reinforcement learning and reasoning design can produce efficient, resilient, and research-grade AI agents.
