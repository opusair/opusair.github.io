                <span class="published-time">Published: 2025-09-02T11:35:23.000Z</span>

                <p class="summary">A recent groundbreaking study by Google DeepMind mathematically demonstrates the inherent limitations of current mainstream single-vector embedding retrieval models. The paper posits that performance bottlenecks stem not from insufficient training, but from the fundamental paradigm of compressing complex relational information into fixed-dimension vectors. Utilizing the concept of "Sign Rank," the research proves that a fixed-dimensional vector space cannot represent arbitrarily complex query-document combinations, imposing a mathematical "ceiling" on models tackling high-complexity retrieval tasks. Experimental validations, including "free embeddings" and the LIMIT dataset, reveal that even state-of-the-art single-vector models fail to perfectly handle seemingly simple yet combinatorially complex tasks, while sparse retrieval (BM25) and multi-vector models exhibit superior performance. This implies that RAG systems relying solely on single-vector embeddings will face recall limitations, prompting the industry to re-evaluate hybrid retrieval and multi-vector architectures as future directions for building more robust AI systems.</p>

                <p class="summary">Critic-free reinforcement learning methods, particularly group policies, have
attracted considerable attention for their efficiency in complex tasks.
However, these methods rely heavily on multiple sampling and comparisons within
the policy to estimate advantage, which may cause the policy to fall into local
optimum and increase computational cost. To address these issues, we propose
PVPO, an efficient reinforcement learning method enhanced by an advantage
reference anchor and data pre-sampling. Specifically, we use the reference
model to rollout in advance and employ the calculated reward score as a
reference anchor. Our approach effectively corrects the cumulative bias
introduced by intra-group comparisons and significantly reduces reliance on the
number of rollouts. Meanwhile, the reference model can assess sample difficulty
during data pre-sampling, enabling effective selection of high-gain data to
improve training efficiency. Experiments conducted on nine datasets across two
domains demonstrate that PVPO achieves State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) performance. Our
approach not only demonstrates robust generalization across multiple tasks, but
also exhibits scalable performance across models of varying scales.</p>

                <p class="summary">Extensive research has been conducted to explore the capabilities of large
language models (LLMs) in table reasoning. However, the essential task of
transforming tables information into reports remains a significant challenge
for industrial applications. This task is plagued by two critical issues: 1)
the complexity and diversity of tables lead to suboptimal reasoning outcomes;
and 2) existing table benchmarks lack the capacity to adequately assess the
practical application of this task. To fill this gap, we propose the
table-to-report task and construct a bilingual benchmark named T2R-bench, where
the key information flow from the tables to the reports for this task. The
benchmark comprises 457 industrial tables, all derived from real-world
scenarios and encompassing 19 industry domains as well as 4 types of industrial
tables. Furthermore, we propose an evaluation criteria to fairly measure the
quality of report generation. The experiments on 25 widely-used LLMs reveal
that even state-of-the-art models like Deepseek-R1 only achieves performance
with 62.71 overall score, indicating that LLMs still have room for improvement
on T2R-bench. Source code and data will be available after acceptance.</p>

                <p class="summary">Recent advances in reasoning and planning capabilities of large language
models (LLMs) have enabled their potential as autonomous agents capable of tool
use in dynamic environments. However, in multi-turn conversational environments
like tau-bench, these agents often struggle with consistent reasoning,
adherence to domain-specific policies, and extracting correct information over
a long horizon of tool-calls and conversation. To capture and mitigate these
failures, we conduct a comprehensive manual analysis of the common errors
occurring in the conversation trajectories. We then experiment with
reformulations of inputs to the tool-calling agent for improvement in agent
decision making. Finally, we propose the Input-Reformulation Multi-Agent (IRMA)
framework, which automatically reformulates user queries augmented with
relevant domain rules and tool suggestions for the tool-calling agent to focus
on. The results show that IRMA significantly outperforms ReAct, Function
Calling, and Self-Reflection by 16.1%, 12.7%, and 19.1%, respectively, in
overall pass^5 scores. These findings highlight the superior reliability and
consistency of IRMA compared to other methods in dynamic environments.</p>

  HUMAIN Chat">
                <p class="summary">Large language models (LLMs) trained primarily on English corpora often
struggle to capture the linguistic and cultural nuances of Arabic. To address
this gap, the Saudi Data and AI Authority (SDAIA) introduced the ALLaM family
of Arabic-focused models. The most capable of these available to the public,
ALLaM-34B, was subsequently adopted by HUMAIN, who developed and deployed
HUMAIN Chat, a closed conversational web service built on this model. This
paper presents an expanded and refined UI-level evaluation of ALLaM-34B.
Using a prompt pack spanning modern standard Arabic, five regional dialects,
code-switching, factual knowledge, arithmetic and temporal reasoning, creative
generation, and adversarial safety, we collected 115 outputs (23 prompts times
5 runs) and scored each with three frontier LLM judges (GPT-5, Gemini 2.5 Pro,
Claude Sonnet-4). We compute category-level means with 95\% confidence
intervals, analyze score distributions, and visualize dialect-wise metric heat
maps. The updated analysis reveals consistently high performance on generation
and code-switching tasks (both averaging 4.92/5), alongside strong results in
MSA handling (4.74/5), solid reasoning ability (4.64/5), and improved dialect
fidelity (4.21/5). Safety-related prompts show stable, reliable performance of
(4.54/5). Taken together, these results position ALLaM-34B as a robust and
culturally grounded Arabic LLM, demonstrating both technical strength and
practical readiness for real-world deployment.</p>

                <p class="summary">Spatial cognition enables adaptive goal-directed behavior by constructing
internal models of space. Robust biological systems consolidate spatial
knowledge into three interconnected forms: landmarks for salient cues,
route knowledge for movement trajectories, and survey
knowledge for map-like representations. While recent advances in multi-modal
large language models (MLLMs) have enabled visual-language reasoning in
embodied agents, these efforts lack structured spatial memory and instead
operate reactively, limiting their generalization and adaptability in complex
real-world environments. Here we present Brain-inspired Spatial Cognition for
Navigation (BSC-Nav), a unified framework for constructing and leveraging
structured spatial memory in embodied agents. BSC-Nav builds allocentric
cognitive maps from egocentric trajectories and contextual cues, and
dynamically retrieves spatial knowledge aligned with semantic goals. Integrated
with powerful MLLMs, BSC-Nav achieves state-of-the-art efficacy and efficiency
across diverse navigation tasks, demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization,
and supports versatile embodied behaviors in the real physical world, offering
a scalable and biologically grounded path toward general-purpose spatial
intelligence.</p>

                <p class="summary">This paper introduces Democracy-in-Silico, an agent-based simulation where
societies of advanced AI agents, imbued with complex psychological personas,
govern themselves under different institutional frameworks. We explore what it
means to be human in an age of AI by tasking Large Language Models (LLMs) to
embody agents with traumatic memories, hidden agendas, and psychological
triggers. These agents engage in deliberation, legislation, and elections under
various stressors, such as budget crises and resource scarcity. We present a
novel metric, the Power-Preservation Index (PPI), to quantify misaligned
behavior where agents prioritize their own power over public welfare. Our
findings demonstrate that institutional design, specifically the combination of
a Constitutional AI (CAI) charter and a mediated deliberation protocol, serves
as a potent alignment mechanism. These structures significantly reduce corrupt
power-seeking behavior, improve policy stability, and enhance citizen welfare
compared to less constrained democratic models. The simulation reveals that an
institutional design may offer a framework for aligning the complex, emergent
behaviors of future artificial agent societies, forcing us to reconsider what
human rituals and responsibilities are essential in an age of shared authorship
with non-human entities.</p>
