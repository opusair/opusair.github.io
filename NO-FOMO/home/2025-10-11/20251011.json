    "title": "Microsoft only lets you opt out of AI photo scanning 3x a year",
    "summary": "Microsoft's OneDrive service is reportedly initiating trials for a new AI-powered photo scanning feature, specifically incorporating face-recognizing artificial intelligence. This functionality is being rolled out to a limited number of preview users, allowing the system to identify and potentially categorize individuals within uploaded photographs. A notable aspect of this new implementation, and one that has drawn significant attention, is Microsoft's restrictive opt-out policy. Users are permitted to decline participation in this AI photo scanning process only three times per year. This limitation has sparked discussions regarding user data privacy, autonomy, and the extent of control individuals have over their personal digital assets within cloud services. Critics argue that such a policy could effectively coerce users into accepting continuous AI surveillance of their photo libraries after exhausting their limited opt-out allowance, raising ethical questions about consent and the persistent monitoring capabilities of cloud-based AI technologies. The development highlights ongoing tensions between technological advancement, user convenience, and fundamental privacy rights in the digital age.",
