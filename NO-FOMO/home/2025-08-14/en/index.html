                <p class="summary">Fran√ßois Fleuret presents a "hot take," suggesting that the universality of language and the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) might be misleading us. He argues that since chains-of-thought can implement virtually any cognitive process, new model architectures might seem unnecessary. He draws an analogy to the universal representation theorem not rendering convolutional neural networks (convnets) unnecessary, implying that current LLM capabilities should not deter the exploration of novel architectures.</p>

                <h2>Is Chain-of-Thought Reasoning a Mirage? Re-examining Large Language Model Inference from a Data Distribution Perspective, Elon Musk Responds, Grok Breaks Down</h2>
                <span class="published-time">Published: 2025-08-14T16:08:29.000Z</span>
                <img src="../screenshot/wechat/wechat_image_S0JuK0nOHV0iekdGUg0f7A.png" alt="Is Chain-of-Thought Reasoning a Mirage? Re-examining Large Language Model Inference from a Data Distribution Perspective, Elon Musk Responds, Grok Breaks Down">
                <p class="summary">A study from Arizona State University reveals that Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning in large language models (LLMs) may not represent true logical deduction but rather a reproduction of patterns within their training data distribution. The research indicates that CoT's generalization capabilities rapidly collapse when tasks deviate from the training data distribution (Out-of-Distribution, OOD), demonstrating fragility across task, length, and format generalization. Using a controllable experimental platform called DataAlchemy, the study confirmed this "mirage" nature, highlighting that CoT's vulnerability is a universal phenomenon, unaffected by model scale or temperature. This finding cautions against blindly relying on CoT in high-stakes domains, suggests that current evaluation methods might overestimate model robustness, and clarifies that supervised fine-tuning only locally extends distribution rather than enhancing abstract reasoning. Future development must acknowledge CoT's generalization limitations and maintain caution in evaluation and deployment.</p>

                <p class="summary">Microsoft researcher Dimitris Papailiopoulos has introduced a groundbreaking reinforcement learning algorithm, Group Filtered Policy Optimization (GFPO), designed to address the issue of lengthy responses generated by models like DeepSeek GRPO. GFPO expands the candidate response pool and explicitly filters for desired properties, enabling it to reduce redundant tokens in inference by up to 80% while simultaneously improving accuracy. This algorithm eliminates the need for complex reward engineering, allowing for the joint optimization of multiple response attributes such as conciseness and accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that GFPO significantly shortens responses across various difficulty levels. Notably, its adaptive difficulty variant efficiently balances computational cost and accuracy when tackling complex problems, and it effectively mitigates length inflation in out-of-distribution tasks, establishing a new paradigm for efficient reinforcement learning.</p>

  Long-Term Memory">
                <p class="summary">We introduce M3-Agent, a novel multimodal agent framework equipped with
long-term memory. Like humans, M3-Agent can process real-time visual and
auditory inputs to build and update its long-term memory. Beyond episodic
memory, it also develops semantic memory, enabling it to accumulate world
knowledge over time. Its memory is organized in an entity-centric, multimodal
format, allowing deeper and more consistent understanding of the environment.
Given an instruction, M3-Agent autonomously performs multi-turn, iterative
reasoning and retrieves relevant information from memory to accomplish the
task. To evaluate memory effectiveness and memory-based reasoning in multimodal
agents, we develop M3-Bench, a new long-video question answering benchmark.
M3-Bench comprises 100 newly recorded real-world videos captured from a robot's
perspective (M3-Bench-robot) and 929 web-sourced videos across diverse
scenarios (M3-Bench-web). We annotate question-answer pairs designed to test
key capabilities essential for agent applications, such as human understanding,
general knowledge extraction, and cross-modal reasoning. Experimental results
show that M3-Agent, trained via reinforcement learning, outperforms the
strongest baseline, a prompting agent using Gemini-1.5-pro and GPT-4o,
achieving 6.7%, 7.7%, and 5.3% higher accuracy on M3-Bench-robot, M3-Bench-web

                <p class="summary">Generating high-fidelity human videos that match user-specified identities is
important yet challenging in the field of generative AI. Existing methods often
rely on an excessive number of training parameters and lack compatibility with
other AIGC tools. In this paper, we propose Stand-In, a lightweight and
plug-and-play framework for identity preservation in video generation.
Specifically, we introduce a conditional image branch into the pre-trained
video generation model. Identity control is achieved through restricted
self-attentions with conditional position mapping, and can be learned quickly
with only 2000 pairs. Despite incorporating and training just sim1\%
additional parameters, our framework achieves excellent results in video
quality and identity preservation, outperforming other full-parameter training
methods. Moreover, our framework can be seamlessly integrated for other tasks,
such as subject-driven video generation, pose-referenced video generation,
stylization, and face swapping.</p>

  Imitation-Exploration Balance">
                <p class="summary">Large Language Models (LLMs) are typically fine-tuned for reasoning tasks
through a two-stage pipeline of Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) followed by
Reinforcement Learning (RL), a process fraught with catastrophic forgetting and
suboptimal trade-offs between imitation and exploration. Recent single-stage
methods attempt to unify SFT and RL using heuristics, but lack a principled
mechanism for dynamically balancing the two paradigms. In this paper, we
reframe this challenge through the theoretical lens of implicit
rewards, viewing SFT and RL not as distinct methods but as complementary
reward signals. We introduce Adaptive Meta Fine-Tuning (AMFT), a novel
single-stage algorithm that learns the optimal balance between SFT's implicit,
path-level reward and RL's explicit, outcome-based reward. The core of AMFT is
a meta-gradient adaptive weight controller that treats the SFT-RL
balance as a learnable parameter, dynamically optimizing it to maximize
long-term task performance. This forward-looking approach, regularized by
policy entropy for stability, autonomously discovers an effective training
curriculum. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation on challenging benchmarks
spanning mathematical reasoning, abstract visual reasoning (General Points),
and vision-language navigation (V-IRL). AMFT consistently establishes a new
state-of-the-art and demonstrats superior generalization on out-of-distribution
(OOD) tasks. Ablation studies and training dynamic analysis confirm that the
meta-learning controller is crucial for AMFT's stability, sample efficiency,
and performance, offering a more principled and effective paradigm for LLM
alignment.Our codes are open-sourced via https://github.com/hlxtsyj/AMFT.</p>

                <p class="summary">Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have significantly advanced the
integration of visual and textual understanding. However, their ability to
generate code from multimodal inputs remains limited. In this work, we
introduce VisCodex, a unified framework that seamlessly merges vision and
coding language models to empower MLLMs with strong multimodal code generation
abilities. Leveraging a task vector-based model merging technique, we integrate
a state-of-the-art coding LLM into a strong vision-language backbone, while
preserving both visual comprehension and advanced coding skills. To support
training and evaluation, we introduce the Multimodal Coding Dataset (MCD), a
large-scale and diverse collection of 598k samples, including high-quality HTML
code, chart image-code pairs, image-augmented StackOverflow QA, and algorithmic
problems. Furthermore, we propose InfiBench-V, a novel and challenging
benchmark specifically designed to assess models on visually-rich, real-world
programming questions that demand a nuanced understanding of both textual and
visual contexts. Extensive experiments show that VisCodex achieves
state-of-the-art performance among open-source MLLMs and approaches proprietary
models like GPT-4o, highlighting the effectiveness of our model merging
strategy and new datasets.</p>

  GAIA Problem Solving">
                <p class="summary">The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has empowered
intelligent agents to leverage diverse external tools for solving complex
real-world problems. However, as agents increasingly depend on multiple tools,
they encounter new challenges: extended contexts from disparate sources and
noisy or irrelevant tool outputs can undermine system reliability and accuracy.
These challenges underscore the necessity for enhanced stability in agent-based
systems. To address this, we introduce dynamic supervision and maneuvering
mechanisms, constructing a robust and dynamic Multi-Agent System (MAS)
architecture within the AWorld framework. In our approach, the Execution Agent
invokes the Guard Agent at critical steps to verify and correct the reasoning
process, effectively reducing errors arising from noise and bolstering
problem-solving robustness. Extensive experiments on the GAIA test dataset
reveal that our dynamic maneuvering mechanism significantly improves both the
effectiveness and stability of solutions, outperforming single-agent system
(SAS) and standard tool-augmented systems. As a result, our dynamic MAS system
achieved first place among open-source projects on the prestigious GAIA
leaderboard. These findings highlight the practical value of collaborative
agent roles in developing more reliable and trustworthy intelligent systems.</p>

  Image Generation">
                <p class="summary">Recently, GPT-4o has garnered significant attention for its strong
performance in image generation, yet open-source models still lag behind.
Several studies have explored distilling image data from GPT-4o to enhance
open-source models, achieving notable progress. However, a key question
remains: given that real-world image datasets already constitute a natural
source of high-quality data, why should we use GPT-4o-generated synthetic data?
In this work, we identify two key advantages of synthetic images. First, they
can complement rare scenarios in real-world datasets, such as surreal fantasy
or multi-reference image generation, which frequently occur in user queries.
Second, they provide clean and controllable supervision. Real-world data often
contains complex background noise and inherent misalignment between text
descriptions and image content, whereas synthetic images offer pure backgrounds
and long-tailed supervision signals, facilitating more accurate text-to-image
alignment. Building on these insights, we introduce Echo-4o-Image, a 180K-scale
synthetic dataset generated by GPT-4o, harnessing the power of synthetic image
data to address blind spots in real-world coverage. Using this dataset, we
fine-tune the unified multimodal generation baseline Bagel to obtain Echo-4o.
In addition, we propose two new evaluation benchmarks for a more accurate and
challenging assessment of image generation capabilities: GenEval++, which
increases instruction complexity to mitigate score saturation, and
Imagine-Bench, which focuses on evaluating both the understanding and
generation of imaginative content. Echo-4o demonstrates strong performance
across standard benchmarks. Moreover, applying Echo-4o-Image to other
foundation models (e.g., OmniGen2, BLIP3-o) yields consistent performance gains
across multiple metrics, highlighting the datasets strong transferability.</p>
