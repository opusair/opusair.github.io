    "summary": "Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents have demonstrated remarkable progress in automating complex user interface interactions through reinforcement learning. However, current approaches face a fundamental dilemma: offline RL enables stable training on pre-collected trajectories, but struggles with multi-step task execution for lack of trajectory-level reward signals; online RL captures these signals through environment interaction, but suffers from sparse rewards and prohibitive deployment costs. To address it, we present Semi-online Reinforcement Learning, a novel paradigm that simulates online RL on offline trajectories. During each rollout process, we preserve the original model output within the multi-turn dialogue, where a Patch Module adaptively recovers the divergence between rollout and expert trajectories. To capture long-term training signals, Semi-online RL introduces discounted future returns into the reward computation and optimizes the policy with weighted step-level and episode-level advantages. We further introduce Semi-Online Performance (SOP), a metric that aligns better with true online performance, serving as a practical and effective proxy for real-world evaluation. Experiments show that ours Semi-online RL achieves SOTA performance among 7B models across four dynamic benchmarks, with significant gains over the base model (e.g., +12.0% on AndroidWorld, +23.8% on AITW), demonstrating significant progress in bridging the gap between offline training efficiency and online multi-turn reasoning.

    "summary": "Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) is essential for training large language models (LLMs), significantly enhancing critical capabilities such as instruction following and in-context learning. Nevertheless, creating suitable training datasets tailored for specific domains remains challenging due to unique domain constraints and data scarcity. In this paper, we propose SearchInstruct, an innovative method explicitly designed to construct high quality instruction datasets for SFT. Our approach begins with a limited set of domain specific, human generated questions, which are systematically expanded using a large language model. Subsequently, domain relevant resources are dynamically retrieved to generate accurate and contextually appropriate answers for each augmented question. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that SearchInstruct enhances both the diversity and quality of SFT datasets, leading to measurable improvements in LLM performance within specialized domains. Additionally, we show that beyond dataset generation, the proposed method can also effectively facilitate tasks such as model editing, enabling efficient updates to existing models. To facilitate reproducibility and community adoption, we provide full implementation details, the complete set of generated instruction response pairs, and the source code in a publicly accessible Git repository: [https://github.com/mostafaamiri/SearchInstruct](https://github.com/mostafaamiri/SearchInstruct)",

    "summary": "The reliance on implicit point matching via attention has become a core bottleneck in drag-based editing, resulting in a fundamental compromise on weakened inversion strength and costly test-time optimization (TTO). This compromise severely limits the generative capabilities of diffusion models, suppressing high-fidelity inpainting and text-guided creation. In this paper, we introduce LazyDrag, the first drag-based image editing method for Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformers, which directly eliminates the reliance on implicit point matching. In concrete terms, our method generates an explicit correspondence map from user drag inputs as a reliable reference to boost the attention control. This reliable reference opens the potential for a stable full-strength inversion process, which is the first in the drag-based editing task. It obviates the necessity for TTO and unlocks the generative capability of models. Therefore, LazyDrag naturally unifies precise geometric control with text guidance, enabling complex edits that were previously out of reach: opening the mouth of a dog and inpainting its interior, generating new objects like a \"tennis ball\", or for ambiguous drags, making context-aware changes like moving a hand into a pocket. Additionally, LazyDrag supports multi-round workflows with simultaneous move and scale operations. Evaluated on the DragBench, our method outperforms baselines in drag accuracy and perceptual quality, as validated by VIEScore and human evaluation. LazyDrag not only establishes new state-of-the-art performance, but also paves a new way to editing paradigms.",

We present HumbleBench, a new hallucination benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs' ability to reject plausible but incorrect answers across three hallucination types: object, relation, and attribute. Built from a panoptic scene graph dataset, we leverage fine-grained scene graph annotations to extract ground-truth entities and relations, and prompt GPT-4-Turbo to generate multiple-choice questions, followed by a rigorous manual filtering process. Each question includes a \"None of the above\" option, requiring models not only to recognize correct visual information but also to identify when no provided answer is valid. We evaluate a variety of state-of-the-art MLLMs -- including both general-purpose and specialized reasoning models -- on HumbleBench and share valuable findings and insights with the community. By incorporating explicit false-option rejection, HumbleBench fills a key gap in current evaluation suites, providing a more realistic measure of MLLM reliability in safety-critical settings. Our code and dataset are released publicly and can be accessed at https://github.com/maifoundations/HumbleBench.",

    "title": "Nav-R1: Reasoning and Navigation in Embodied Scenes",
    "summary": "Embodied navigation requires agents to integrate perception, reasoning, and action for robust interaction in complex 3D environments. Existing approaches often suffer from incoherent and unstable reasoning traces that hinder generalization across diverse environments, and difficulty balancing long-horizon semantic reasoning with low-latency control for real-time navigation. To address these challenges, we propose Nav-R1, an embodied foundation model that unifies reasoning in embodied environments. We first construct Nav-CoT-110K, a large-scale dataset of step-by-step Chains-of-Thought (CoT) for embodied tasks, which enables cold-start initialization with structured reasoning. Building on this foundation, we design a GRPO-based reinforcement learning framework with three complementary rewards: format, understanding, and navigation, to improve structural adherence, semantic grounding, and path fidelity. Furthermore, we introduce a Fast-in-Slow reasoning paradigm, decoupling deliberate semantic reasoning from low-latency reactive control for efficient yet coherent navigation. Extensive evaluations on embodied AI benchmarks demonstrate that Nav-R1 consistently outperforms strong baselines, with over 8% average improvement in reasoning and navigation performance. Real-world deployment on a mobile robot further validates its robustness under limited onboard resources.",

    "title": "Learning to Optimize Multi-Objective Alignment Through Dynamic Reward Weighting",
    "summary": "Prior works in multi-objective reinforcement learning typically use linear reward scalarization with fixed weights, which provably fail to capture non-convex Pareto fronts and thus yield suboptimal results. This limitation becomes especially critical in online preference alignment for large language models. Here, stochastic trajectories generated by parameterized policies create highly non-linear and non-convex mappings from parameters to objectives that no single static weighting scheme can find optimal trade-offs. We address this limitation by introducing dynamic reward weighting, which adaptively adjusts reward weights during the online reinforcement learning process. Unlike existing approaches that rely on fixed-weight interpolation, our dynamic weighting continuously balances and prioritizes objectives in training, facilitating effective exploration of Pareto fronts in objective space. We introduce two approaches of increasing sophistication and generalizability: (1) hypervolume-guided weight adaptation and (2) gradient-based weight optimization, offering a versatile toolkit for online multi-objective alignment. Our extensive experiments demonstrate their compatibility with commonly used online reinforcement learning algorithms (including GRPO, REINFORCE, and RLOO), effectiveness across multiple mathematical reasoning datasets, and applicability to different model families, consistently achieving Pareto dominant solutions with fewer training steps than fixed-weight linear scalarization baselines.",
