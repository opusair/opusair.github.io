                <p class="summary">Flow-GRPO marks a pioneering advancement by integrating online reinforcement learning into Flow Matching generative models. This innovative framework transforms deterministic Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) samplers into equivalent Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) samplers, thereby introducing the necessary stochasticity for online RL application and optimizing the denoising process. By incorporating the GRPO algorithm, Flow-GRPO effectively addresses the inherent challenges of Flow Models in handling complex scenarios such as multi-object composition, spatial relationships, and accurate text rendering. Experimental results demonstrate that Flow-GRPO significantly enhances the accuracy and human preference alignment of text-to-image (T2I) generation. Furthermore, its novel Denoising Reduction strategy substantially accelerates the training process without compromising output quality. This breakthrough opens new avenues for developing high-quality generative models capable of producing intricate and precise visual content.</p>

                <p class="summary">Artificial intelligence has achieved groundbreaking advancements in physics, marking what is being called the "AlphaGo moment for physics." AI successfully designed counter-intuitive and highly complex optical component layouts, significantly boosting the sensitivity of the LIGO gravitational wave detector by 10-15%, a remarkable feat that addresses a challenge puzzling physicists for decades. Furthermore, AI independently redesigned a quantum entanglement experiment, discovered a more accurate dark matter formula than those previously proposed by human scientists, and even independently rediscovered "Lorentz symmetry," a fundamental cornerstone of Einstein's theory of relativity, without prior physical knowledge. These compelling cases demonstrate that AI is rapidly evolving from a mere computational tool into an indispensable and powerful scientific collaborator, signaling the imminent arrival of an era where AI profoundly assists in discovering entirely new physics.</p>

                <p class="summary">GitHub CEO Thomas Dohmke has announced his resignation, and GitHub will no longer operate independently, instead being fully integrated into Microsoft's newly formed CoreAI engineering group. This strategic move signifies GitHub's transformation from a mere code hosting platform into Microsoft's "AI agent factory" and "AI training ground," aiming to drive an "AI-first" software development paradigm through tools like Copilot. Microsoft's deep integration of GitHub into its AI division suggests a future where developers may increasingly supervise AI-generated code rather than writing it from scratch. This profound change is not merely a personnel shift but a complete reorientation of the software development model. Developers must adapt to GitHub's new role as a core component of Microsoft's AI arsenal. The article highlights GitHub's significant growth under Dohmke's leadership, with over 1.5 billion developers and 1 billion repositories, and Copilot's success as a leading AI coding assistant. Dohmke's departure to pursue new entrepreneurial ventures underscores the completion of his mission to lead GitHub into the AI era. This integration solidifies Microsoft's vision of embedding AI assistants across its product ecosystem, positioning GitHub at the forefront of this "Copilotization" strategy.</p>

                <p class="summary">The article highlights a growing issue where large language models (LLMs), despite their advanced “deep thinking” capabilities enabled by reasoning and Chain of Thought, increasingly overcomplicate simple tasks. Experts like Andrej Karpathy observe that LLMs, by default, exhibit an excessive “agentic” tendency, engaging in lengthy reasoning processes for straightforward queries. This leads to slow responses and inefficiency, particularly evident in coding and image editing applications. The phenomenon is attributed to LLMs being heavily optimized for long-duration, complex task benchmarks, causing them to treat all tasks as high-stakes “exams.” The piece emphasizes the critical need for users to have a mechanism to explicitly specify the required depth of thought for a given task, thereby preventing unnecessary overthinking and enhancing the practical utility of LLMs. This adjustment is crucial for improving user experience and operational efficiency across various applications.</p>

                <p class="summary">Recent advances at the intersection of reinforcement learning (RL) and visual
intelligence have enabled agents that not only perceive complex visual scenes
but also reason, generate, and act within them. This survey offers a critical
and up-to-date synthesis of the field. We first formalize visual RL problems
and trace the evolution of policy-optimization strategies from RLHF to
verifiable reward paradigms, and from Proximal Policy Optimization to Group
Relative Policy Optimization. We then organize more than 200 representative
works into four thematic pillars: multi-modal large language models, visual
generation, unified model frameworks, and vision-language-action models. For
each pillar we examine algorithmic design, reward engineering, benchmark
progress, and we distill trends such as curriculum-driven training,
preference-aligned diffusion, and unified reward modeling. Finally, we review
evaluation protocols spanning set-level fidelity, sample-level preference, and
state-level stability, and we identify open challenges that include sample
efficiency, generalization, and safe deployment. Our goal is to provide
researchers and practitioners with a coherent map of the rapidly expanding
landscape of visual RL and to highlight promising directions for future
inquiry. Resources are available at:

  Bridging Foundation Models and Lifelong Agentic Systems">
                <p class="summary">Recent advances in large language models have sparked growing interest in AI
agents capable of solving complex, real-world tasks. However, most existing
agent systems rely on manually crafted configurations that remain static after
deployment, limiting their ability to adapt to dynamic and evolving
environments. To this end, recent research has explored agent evolution
techniques that aim to automatically enhance agent systems based on interaction
data and environmental feedback. This emerging direction lays the foundation
for self-evolving AI agents, which bridge the static capabilities of foundation
models with the continuous adaptability required by lifelong agentic systems.
In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of existing techniques for
self-evolving agentic systems. Specifically, we first introduce a unified
conceptual framework that abstracts the feedback loop underlying the design of
self-evolving agentic systems. The framework highlights four key components:
System Inputs, Agent System, Environment, and Optimisers, serving as a
foundation for understanding and comparing different strategies. Based on this
framework, we systematically review a wide range of self-evolving techniques
that target different components of the agent system. We also investigate
domain-specific evolution strategies developed for specialised fields such as
biomedicine, programming, and finance, where optimisation objectives are
tightly coupled with domain constraints. In addition, we provide a dedicated
discussion on the evaluation, safety, and ethical considerations for
self-evolving agentic systems, which are critical to ensuring their
effectiveness and reliability. This survey aims to provide researchers and
practitioners with a systematic understanding of self-evolving AI agents,
laying the foundation for the development of more adaptive, autonomous, and
lifelong agentic systems.</p>

                <img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2508.07981.png" alt="Omni-Effects: Unified and Spatially-Controllable Visual Effects
  Generation">
                <p class="summary">Visual effects (VFX) are essential visual enhancements fundamental to modern
cinematic production. Although video generation models offer cost-efficient
solutions for VFX production, current methods are constrained by per-effect
LoRA training, which limits generation to single effects. This fundamental
limitation impedes applications that require spatially controllable composite
effects, i.e., the concurrent generation of multiple effects at designated
locations. However, integrating diverse effects into a unified framework faces
major challenges: interference from effect variations and spatial
uncontrollability during multi-VFX joint training. To tackle these challenges,
we propose Omni-Effects, a first unified framework capable of generating
prompt-guided effects and spatially controllable composite effects. The core of
our framework comprises two key innovations: (1) LoRA-based Mixture of Experts
(LoRA-MoE), which employs a group of expert LoRAs, integrating diverse effects
within a unified model while effectively mitigating cross-task interference.
(2) Spatial-Aware Prompt (SAP) incorporates spatial mask information into the
text token, enabling precise spatial control. Furthermore, we introduce an
Independent-Information Flow (IIF) module integrated within the SAP, isolating
the control signals corresponding to individual effects to prevent any unwanted
blending. To facilitate this research, we construct a comprehensive VFX dataset
Omni-VFX via a novel data collection pipeline combining image editing and
First-Last Frame-to-Video (FLF2V) synthesis, and introduce a dedicated VFX
evaluation framework for validating model performance. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that Omni-Effects achieves precise spatial control and diverse
effect generation, enabling users to specify both the category and location of
desired effects.</p>

                <img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2508.07999.png" alt="WideSearch: Benchmarking Agentic Broad Info-Seeking">
                <p class="summary">From professional research to everyday planning, many tasks are bottlenecked
by wide-scale information seeking, which is more repetitive than cognitively
complex. With the rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs), automated
search agents powered by LLMs offer a promising solution to liberate humans
from this tedious work. However, the capability of these agents to perform such
"wide-context" collection reliably and completely remains largely unevaluated
due to a lack of suitable benchmarks. To bridge this gap, we introduce
WideSearch, a new benchmark engineered to evaluate agent reliability on these
large-scale collection tasks. The benchmark features 200 manually curated
questions (100 in English, 100 in Chinese) from over 15 diverse domains,
grounded in real user queries. Each task requires agents to collect large-scale
atomic information, which could be verified one by one objectively, and arrange
it into a well-organized output. A rigorous five-stage quality control pipeline
ensures the difficulty, completeness, and verifiability of the dataset. We
benchmark over 10 state-of-the-art agentic search systems, including
single-agent, multi-agent frameworks, and end-to-end commercial systems. Most
systems achieve overall success rates near 0\%, with the best performer
reaching just 5\%. However, given sufficient time, cross-validation by multiple
human testers can achieve a near 100\% success rate. These results demonstrate
that present search agents have critical deficiencies in large-scale
information seeking, underscoring urgent areas for future research and
development in agentic search. Our dataset, evaluation pipeline, and benchmark
results have been publicly released at https://widesearch-seed.github.io/</p>

                <p class="summary">Reasoning is central to purposeful action, yet most robotic foundation models
map perception and instructions directly to control, which limits adaptability,
generalization, and semantic grounding. We introduce Action Reasoning Models
(ARMs), a class of vision-language-action models that integrate perception,
planning, and control through a structured three-stage pipeline. Our model,
MolmoAct, encodes observations and instructions into depth-aware perception
tokens, generates mid-level spatial plans as editable trajectory traces, and
predicts precise low-level actions, enabling explainable and steerable
behavior. MolmoAct-7B-D achieves strong performance across simulation and
real-world settings: 70.5% zero-shot accuracy on SimplerEnv Visual Matching
tasks, surpassing closed-source Pi-0 and GR00T N1; 86.6% average success on
LIBERO, including an additional 6.3% gain over ThinkAct on long-horizon tasks;
and in real-world fine-tuning, an additional 10% (single-arm) and an additional
22.7% (bimanual) task progression over Pi-0-FAST. It also outperforms baselines
by an additional 23.3% on out-of-distribution generalization and achieves top
human-preference scores for open-ended instruction following and trajectory
steering. Furthermore, we release, for the first time, the MolmoAct Dataset --
a mid-training robot dataset comprising over 10,000 high quality robot
trajectories across diverse scenarios and tasks. Training with this dataset
yields an average 5.5% improvement in general performance over the base model.
We release all model weights, training code, our collected dataset, and our
action reasoning dataset, establishing MolmoAct as both a state-of-the-art
robotics foundation model and an open blueprint for building ARMs that
transform perception into purposeful action through structured reasoning.

                <p class="summary">The Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture is a cornerstone of modern
state-of-the-art (SOTA) large language models (LLMs). MoE models facilitate
scalability by enabling sparse parameter activation. However, traditional MoE
architecture uses homogeneous experts of a uniform size, activating a fixed
number of parameters irrespective of input complexity and thus limiting
computational efficiency. To overcome this limitation, we introduce Grove MoE,
a novel architecture incorporating experts of varying sizes, inspired by the
heterogeneous big.LITTLE CPU architecture. This architecture features novel
adjugate experts with a dynamic activation mechanism, enabling model capacity
expansion while maintaining manageable computational overhead. Building on this
architecture, we present GroveMoE-Base and GroveMoE-Inst, 33B-parameter LLMs
developed by applying an upcycling strategy to the Qwen3-30B-A3B-Base model
during mid-training and post-training. GroveMoE models dynamically activate
3.14-3.28B parameters based on token complexity and achieve performance
comparable to SOTA open-source models of similar or even larger size.</p>
