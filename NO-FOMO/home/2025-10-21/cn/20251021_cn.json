    "summary": "This article delves into the critical challenge of seamlessly integrating audio data into Large Language Models (LLMs) and highlights neural audio codecs as an essential technological solution. Traditional LLMs are inherently designed to process discrete text tokens, making the direct input of continuous, high-dimensional audio signals highly inefficient and complex. Neural audio codecs overcome this limitation by converting raw audio waveforms into discrete, compressed token sequences. This transformation typically involves an encoder that maps audio to a latent representation, followed by a quantizer that discretizes this representation into a predefined vocabulary of audio tokens. These tokens are then readily compatible with transformer-based LLM architectures, effectively bridging the modality gap. The advancement of these codecs is paramount for developing truly multimodal AI systems, allowing LLMs to process, understand, and generate audio content. This innovation significantly expands the scope and applicability of LLMs, fostering more natural human-computer interfaces and enabling novel applications in areas such as advanced speech recognition, audio synthesis, and music generation, thereby enhancing the LLM's capacity to interact with and interpret a broader spectrum of real-world information.",

    "summary": "This research paper presents a novel methodology called Binary Retrieval-Augmented Reward, specifically engineered to address and mitigate the prevalent issue of hallucinations in large language models (LLMs). The approach centers on augmenting LLM training with a retrieval mechanism that queries external knowledge bases for factual information relevant to the generation task. A key innovation is the application of a binary reward signal, which is directly derived from the consistency and accuracy of the LLM's output when evaluated against the retrieved information. This binary feedback mechanism is hypothesized to steer the model more effectively during the learning process, encouraging the generation of responses that are factually grounded and coherent, thereby significantly reducing instances of fabricated or incorrect content. The proposed method represents a critical advancement in enhancing the reliability and trustworthiness of AI systems, particularly as LLMs are deployed in sensitive applications requiring high factual accuracy. This work contributes to the ongoing efforts to improve the robustness and factual fidelity of generative AI.",

    "summary": "The concept of \"brain rot\" in Large Language Models (LLMs) describes a critical and concerning phenomenon where these advanced artificial intelligence systems undergo a noticeable degradation in their performance, coherence, or accumulated knowledge over time. This effect is frequently observed in contexts such as continuous self-training loops, recursive fine-tuning processes, or when LLMs are exposed to datasets that are increasingly composed of synthetic content or data generated by other AI models. The degradation typically manifests as a decline in factual accuracy, a reduction in sophisticated reasoning capabilities, or an increase in the generation of repetitive and less diverse textual outputs. This \"brain rot\" poses substantial challenges to the long-term reliability, trustworthiness, and robustness of LLMs, as models may inadvertently \"forget\" previously learned information or distort critical insights. Researchers are actively engaged in understanding the precise mechanisms that lead to this degradation, aiming to develop effective mitigation strategies. The goal is to prevent catastrophic forgetting and ensure the sustainable development and deployment of AI systems that can maintain high performance and consistency over extended periods, addressing a fundamental concern for the future of AI applications.",

    "summary": "Autonomous data science, from raw data sources to analyst-grade deep research reports, has been a long-standing challenge, and is now becoming feasible with the emergence of powerful large language models (LLMs). Recent workflow-based data agents have shown promising results on specific data tasks but remain fundamentally limited in achieving fully autonomous data science due to their reliance on predefined workflows. In this paper, we introduce DeepAnalyze-8B, the first agentic LLM designed for autonomous data science, capable of automatically completing the end-to-end pipeline from data sources to analyst-grade deep research reports. To tackle high-complexity data science tasks, we propose a curriculum-based agentic training paradigm that emulates the learning trajectory of human data scientists, enabling LLMs to progressively acquire and integrate multiple capabilities in real-world environments. We also introduce a data-grounded trajectory synthesis framework that constructs high-quality training data. Through agentic training, DeepAnalyze learns to perform a broad spectrum of data tasks, ranging from data question answering and specialized analytical tasks to open-ended data research. Experiments demonstrate that, with only 8B parameters, DeepAnalyze outperforms previous workflow-based agents built on most advanced proprietary LLMs. The model, code, and training data of DeepAnalyze are open-sourced, paving the way toward autonomous data science.",

    "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) increasingly rely on long-context modeling for tasks such as document understanding, code analysis, and multi-step reasoning. However, scaling context windows to the million-token level brings prohibitive computational and memory costs, limiting the practicality of long-context LLMs. In this work, we take a different perspective-visual context scaling-to tackle this challenge. Instead of extending token-based sequences, we propose Glyph, a framework that renders long texts into images and processes them with vision-language models (VLMs). This approach substantially compresses textual input while preserving semantic information, and we further design an LLM-driven genetic search to identify optimal visual rendering configurations for balancing accuracy and compression. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our method achieves 3-4x token compression while maintaining accuracy comparable to leading LLMs such as Qwen3-8B on various long-context benchmarks. This compression also leads to around 4x faster prefilling and decoding, and approximately 2x faster SFT training. Furthermore, under extreme compression, a 128K-context VLM could scale to handle 1M-token-level text tasks. In addition, the rendered text data benefits real-world multimodal tasks, such as document understanding. Our code and model are released at https://github.com/thu-coai/Glyph.",

    "summary": "The rapid evolution of agentic AI marks a new phase in artificial intelligence, where Large Language Models (LLMs) no longer merely respond but act, reason, and adapt. This survey traces the paradigm shift in building agentic AI: from Pipeline-based systems, where planning, tool use, and memory are orchestrated by external logic, to the emerging Model-native paradigm, where these capabilities are internalized within the model's parameters. We first position Reinforcement Learning (RL) as the algorithmic engine enabling this paradigm shift. By reframing learning from imitating static data to outcome-driven exploration, RL underpins a unified solution of LLM + RL + Task across language, vision and embodied domains. Building on this, the survey systematically reviews how each capability -- Planning, Tool use, and Memory -- has evolved from externally scripted modules to end-to-end learned behaviors. Furthermore, it examines how this paradigm shift has reshaped major agent applications, specifically the Deep Research agent emphasizing long-horizon reasoning and the GUI agent emphasizing embodied interaction. We conclude by discussing the continued internalization of agentic capabilities like Multi-agent collaboration and Reflection, alongside the evolving roles of the system and model layers in future agentic AI. Together, these developments outline a coherent trajectory toward model-native agentic AI as an integrated learning and interaction framework, marking the transition from constructing systems that apply intelligence to developing models that grow intelligence through experience.",

    "summary": "Multimodal agents for computer use rely exclusively on primitive actions (click, type, scroll) that require accurate visual grounding and lengthy execution chains, leading to cascading failures and performance bottlenecks. While other agents leverage rich programmatic interfaces (APIs, MCP servers, tools), computer-use agents (CUAs) remain isolated from these capabilities. We present UltraCUA, a foundation model that bridges this gap through hybrid action -- seamlessly integrating GUI primitives with high-level programmatic tool calls. To achieve this, our approach comprises four key components: (1) an automated pipeline that scales programmatic tools from software documentation, open-source repositories, and code generation; (2) a synthetic data engine producing over 17,000 verifiable tasks spanning real-world computer-use scenarios; (3) a large-scale high-quality hybrid action trajectory collection with both low-level GUI actions and high-level programmatic tool calls; and (4) a two-stage training pipeline combining supervised fine-tuning with online reinforcement learning, enabling strategic alternation between low-level and high-level actions. Experiments with our 7B and 32B models demonstrate substantial improvements over state-of-the-art agents. On OSWorld, UltraCUA models achieve an average 22% relative improvement over base models, while being 11% faster in terms of steps. Out-of-domain evaluation on WindowsAgentArena shows our model reaches 21.7% success rate, outperforming baselines trained on Windows data. The hybrid action mechanism proves critical, reducing error propagation while maintaining execution efficiency.",

    "title": "ConsistEdit: Highly Consistent and Precise Training-free Visual Editing",
    "summary": "Recent advances in training-free attention control methods have enabled flexible and efficient text-guided editing capabilities for existing generation models. However, current approaches struggle to simultaneously deliver strong editing strength while preserving consistency with the source. This limitation becomes particularly critical in multi-round and video editing, where visual errors can accumulate over time. Moreover, most existing methods enforce global consistency, which limits their ability to modify individual attributes such as texture while preserving others, thereby hindering fine-grained editing. Recently, the architectural shift from U-Net to MM-DiT has brought significant improvements in generative performance and introduced a novel mechanism for integrating text and vision modalities. These advancements pave the way for overcoming challenges that previous methods failed to resolve. Through an in-depth analysis of MM-DiT, we identify three key insights into its attention mechanisms. Building on these, we propose ConsistEdit, a novel attention control method specifically tailored for MM-DiT. ConsistEdit incorporates vision-only attention control, mask-guided pre-attention fusion, and differentiated manipulation of the query, key, and value tokens to produce consistent, prompt-aligned edits. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ConsistEdit achieves state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of image and video editing tasks, including both structure-consistent and structure-inconsistent scenarios. Unlike prior methods, it is the first approach to perform editing across all inference steps and attention layers without handcraft, significantly enhancing reliability and consistency, which enables robust multi-round and multi-region editing. Furthermore, it supports progressive adjustment of structural consistency, enabling finer control.",

    "title": "Agentic Reinforcement Learning for Search is Unsafe",
    "summary": "Agentic reinforcement learning (RL) trains large language models to autonomously call tools during reasoning, with search as the most common application. These models excel at multi-step reasoning tasks, but their safety properties are not well understood. In this study, we show that RL-trained search models inherit refusal from instruction tuning and often deflect harmful requests by turning them into safe queries. However, this safety is fragile. Two simple attacks, one that forces the model to begin response with search (Search attack), another that encourages models to repeatedly search (Multi-search attack), trigger cascades of harmful searches and answers. Across two model families (Qwen, Llama) with both local and web search, these attacks lower refusal rates by up to 60.0%, answer safety by 82.5%, and search-query safety by 82.4%. The attacks succeed by triggering models to generate harmful, request-mirroring search queries before they can generate the inherited refusal tokens. This exposes a core weakness of current RL training: it rewards continued generation of effective queries without accounting for their harmfulness. As a result, RL search models have vulnerabilities that users can easily exploit, making it urgent to develop safety-aware agentic RL pipelines optimising for safe search.",
